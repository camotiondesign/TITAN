When Sarah took over Riverside Pharmacy, it was processing 6,000 items a month.

Today it's doing 18,000.

The dispensary runs itself.

She leads clinically.
She grows commercially.

Your dispensary isn't slow.

Your PMR is.

Legacy systems force you to work around outdated technology.

Slow workflows.
Manual processes.

✅ Intelligent batch flow: Process 50+ scripts at once
✅ Real-time tracking: Know where everything is instantly
✅ AI-powered automation: Handle routine cases automatically
✅ Mobile access: Work from anywhere in the pharmacy

Hundreds of pharmacies have made the switch.

The NHS wants pharmacies to prescribe.

Not just dispense.

Independent Prescribing Services are expanding rapidly across the UK.

Here's what's changing:

✅ NHS pilot programs in 200+ pharmacies
✅ Pharmacy First expanding services nationwide
✅ Clinical pathways shifting to community pharmacy
✅ Pharmacists gaining prescribing rights

The future isn't coming.

It's here.

Pharmacies that position themselves as health hubs are seeing:
• 40% revenue growth from services
• Stronger patient relationships
• Better clinical outcomes
• Reduced pressure on GPs
• Sustainable, scalable models

But here's the challenge:

Legacy PMRs weren't built for clinical services.
Paper-based workflows slow everything down.
Limited integrations create silos.
Manual documentation eats time.

Pharmacies need systems that support clinical work.

Not just dispensing.

Titanverse brings everything together:
• Consultation templates
• Clinical documentation
• Prescribing integrations
• Service tracking
• Patient management

The pharmacies leading this shift aren't waiting.

They're building now.
