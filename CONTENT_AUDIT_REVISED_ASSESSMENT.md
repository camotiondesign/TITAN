# REVISED ASSESSMENT: "Why Independent Prescribing Fails" Blog

## CORRECTION TO ORIGINAL AUDIT

The original audit incorrectly flagged "Why Independent Prescribing Fails" as a placeholder violation. The actual blog content exists and is substantial editorial work.

## MANIFESTO ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT

### STRONG ALIGNMENT

**Named operators:** Yusuf, Pritee, Rahul, Sagar, Sandeep, Akbar — all explicitly named with specific roles and quotes.

**Specific numbers:** 
- 70% of community pharmacists report high stress
- 93% describe burnout level pressure
- 100% of items checked manually (before state)
- 20-30% checking with Titan (after state)
- 9,600 pharmacies missed fixed PF payments
- 75% not staffed to deliver safely
- 93% saw no staffing increase
- 17,000 items, 2-3 patients/day, 150-200 consults/month, 300 NMSS/month

**Uncomfortable truths named directly:**
- "Independent Prescribing is worthless if your pharmacist cannot get off the bench"
- "The problem is capacity. And capacity is being crushed by the bench"
- "You cannot bolt clinical care onto a workflow held together by firefighting"
- "The workflow cannot support IP"

**Editorial position clear:** The piece takes a decisive stance: workflow is the barrier, not training or willingness. This is editorial spine, not marketing positioning.

**Evidence-led:** Uses sector data, named operator quotes, and specific before/after states. Grounded in operational reality.

**Quotable and referenceable:** Lines like "Independent Prescribing is worthless if your pharmacist cannot get off the bench" can be quoted, referenced, and built upon. This meets the leadership content standard.

### REMAINING VIOLATION

**Marketing CTA at conclusion:** The blog ends with:

> "Learn more about how Titan PMR and Titanverse are helping independent pharmacies thrive.
> 
> 🔗 https://titanpmr.com  
> 🔗 https://titanverse.co.uk"

This violates the manifesto: "We do not exist to generate leads." While softer than "Book a demo today," this is still a marketing CTA treating content as lead generation rather than media property.

**Required fix:** Replace with an editorial conclusion that reinforces the core idea, such as:

> "The future belongs to the pharmacies that free their pharmacists. The workflow fix is not optional. It is the prerequisite for everything the NHS imagines pharmacy can become."

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

This blog post is strong editorial content that aligns with the manifesto's core requirements: it names uncomfortable truths, uses named operators and specific numbers, takes a clear editorial position, and is quotable/referenceable. It demonstrates what leadership content should be: specific, evidence-led, and grounded in operational reality.

The only violation is the marketing CTA at the end, which should be removed and replaced with an editorial conclusion that reinforces the worldview rather than requesting action.

This piece should serve as a template for future leadership content, with the CTA removed.
