# Ideas to Steal

This folder is a competitive intelligence and creative replication library.

It exists to steal what works, analyse why it works, and repurpose the strategy in our tone, our context, and our goals.

## Purpose

- Accelerate campaign creation.
- Reduce guesswork by modelling proven formats.
- Avoid reinventing the wheel when someone already cracked a format.
- Identify patterns behind high performance.

## What to Add

- Screenshots of posts, carousels, videos.
- Links to live content.
- Notes on psychological triggers used.
- Data (if available).
- Breakdown of:
  - Hook
  - Angle
  - Mechanism
  - CTA
  - Results (if known)

## Tagging

Tag by:

- **Platform** (LinkedIn / TikTok / YouTube / Web / Press)
- **Format** (Carousel / Script / Blog / Meme / Stat-driven / Interview)
- **Theme** (AI / NHS / Private Services / Pharmacy Burnout / Leadership / Product Education)
- **Campaign Type**: Titan PMR, Titanverse, Intersection, or Brand

## Subfolders

- **Hooks** — Openings that stop the scroll.
- **Narrative Structures** — How the story is built.
- **Visual Concepts** — Layouts, illustration styles, typography ideas.
- **Retention Tactics** — What keeps people reading or watching.
- **Trigger Mechanics** — Curiosity, tension, controversy, comparison, unmet promise.

## Rules

- We borrow strategy, not identity.
- Never copy wording, design language, or trademarks.
- We extract the mechanism, not the aesthetic.
