# How Puri Pharmacy Doubled Services and Went Fully Digital

Puri Pharmacy is a two-branch, family-run pharmacy serving the communities of Southall and Hillingdon. Together, the team dispenses approximately 18,000 items per month while delivering a wide range of NHS and private services. Since switching to Titan in early 2025, both branches have gone fully paperless, doubled appointment capacity, and adopted a digital-first model that supports high-volume dispensing and service-led growth without the chaos.

## The Challenge

With around 18,000 items a month across Southall and Hillingdon, Puri Pharmacy was always busy. But growth brought pressure. The team was stuck behind the bench, managing high volumes with outdated systems and constant interruptions. Services were squeezed. Paper was everywhere. And pharmacists were spending more time checking boxes than delivering care.

Superintendent pharmacist Rahul Puri wanted to change that. He saw the opportunity to scale both services and digital operations — but only if the right foundation was in place. The goal was clear: free up pharmacist time, simplify the workflow, and build a calm, modern health hub that still felt rooted in the local community.

## How they did it

**Products used in this study:** Titan PMR, Titan Repeat Flow, Titan AI

### 1. Led from the Front, Digitised at the Core

Rahul Puri isn't just the superintendent pharmacist at Puri Pharmacy. He's part of a new generation of pharmacy leaders who blend clinical care, digital innovation and creative communication. When he's not running services, he's on TikTok reaching thousands with videos like "What does your mucus say about you?"

But behind the content is a serious operation. With two busy branches in Southall and Hillingdon, Puri Pharmacy was handling thousands of items each month, but its systems couldn't keep up. The workflow was paper-heavy, pharmacists were tied to the bench, and service growth meant piling on more stress.

In early 2025, Rahul switched both branches to Titan. It didn't just improve efficiency. It gave the business the breathing room to scale.

> "Titan has given me the freedom to lead from the front, clinically, commercially and creatively."

### 2. Replacing Frantic Workflows with Structure and Calm

With Titan in place, both pharmacies are now fully paperless. Every team member sees the same screen, prescriptions are tracked at every stage, and stock is picked without guesswork or disruption.

> "Everyone can see where the prescription is. No one is frantically looking for paper. We've become a paper free pharmacy."
>
> "Now we're fully embracing the digital space in pharmacy. We're busy, but we're never chaotic."

That visibility has created a calmer, more structured environment. Staff are more confident, patients are better served, and the daily rush doesn't feel like firefighting anymore.

### 3. Freeing Up Time to Deliver More Care

Titan Repeat Flow, Titan AI, and integrated SMS have transformed the dispensary into a system that runs smoothly in the background. Pharmacists are no longer stuck checking baskets. That time has been redirected into services.

> "Since implementing Titan in January 2025, it's freed up at least 20 hours a week for a pharmacist in the pharmacy."
>
> "Now we're not having to do checking or archaic tasks we used to do with ProScript. We can offer double the amount of appointments."

Patients now receive prescriptions faster, with automated text alerts, shelf tracking and QR code collection.

> "Patients are collecting their medicines far earlier, and we're actually looking for more work to do."

### 4. Scaling Services, Not Stress

With the pressure off, Rahul and the team have expanded far beyond traditional pharmacy services. The business now delivers weight loss clinics, phlebotomy, private medical cannabis consultations, contraception and more.

> "I don't need to be worried about someone knocking on my door during a service. The system allows for calm and no chaos."
>
> "Now people are commenting, I didn't realise a pharmacy could do this."

The impact is visible in both branches, not just in service volume, but in how the pharmacy is perceived.

> "We're changing our business model from being just a dispensary to a community health hub."

### 5. Built for Growth, Ready to Scale

Titan hasn't just helped the pharmacy manage its current workload; it has also helped the pharmacy manage its future workload. It's made the future scalable. One branch is now undergoing a full renovation, with new consultation rooms planned to meet growing demand.

> "We simply can't accommodate all of the appointments. We need to build bigger and add two or three more consultation rooms."

Rahul's long-term vision combines local care with national reach. With Titan at the core, the team is now preparing for remote clinics, expanded service models, and new digital offerings that extend care beyond the pharmacy walls.

> "We want to build an ecosystem of digital medicine alongside our bricks and mortar."

## The Results

Since switching to Titan, Puri Pharmacy has transformed how it operates, delivers care, and scales services:

- 20 hours per week saved per pharmacist
- 100% paperless across both branches
- Pharmacy First's capacity doubled
- Expanded private clinics including phlebotomy, earwax, contraception, weight loss and cannabis
- Branch expansion underway with new consultation rooms

> "Titan runs our core workflow. It pretty much does the bulk of our dispensing and pharmacy work."
>
> "We're busy, but we're never chaotic."

## The Takeaway

Puri Pharmacy demonstrates what's possible when a pharmacy not only adopts digital tools but also builds a model around them. With Titan powering operations in the background, Rahul has led the team into a new phase, clinically stronger, commercially smarter, and creatively freer to lead from the front.

> "If I could summarise Puri Pharmacy in one sentence, I would say: a modern health hub that blends clinical care, digital innovation and deep community roots."
>
> "Titan has given me the freedom to lead from the front, clinically, commercially and creatively."
