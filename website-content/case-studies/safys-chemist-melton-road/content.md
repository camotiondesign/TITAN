# How Safy's Chemist Cut Near Misses by 97% and Freed 85% of Pharmacist Time

Safy's Chemist on Melton Road has served its community for 45 years. Today, it's one of the busiest pharmacies in the area, dispensing 14,500–15,000 items every month. But a year ago, the pharmacy was averaging 5–6 near misses per month, and pharmacist Asif was spending his entire day checking prescriptions.

Since switching to Titan, near misses have dropped to just 2 in an entire year. Asif now spends 85% of his time on services. And the 80-year-old superintendent? He loves it.

## The Challenge

Safy's Chemist was busy, but the workflow was chaotic. The pharmacy operates in a highly competitive area where patients expect next-day service: "they won't pay an Amazon Prime subscription, but they want it the next day," Asif explains. This constant pressure created a dangerous cycle: Asif was constantly running between the consultation room and the dispensary, trying to squeeze services in between checking prescriptions. The workflow was hectic, with staff trying to squeeze in services amongst all the checking at the back.

Baskets piled up. Mistakes happened. The consequences were serious: near misses were occurring regularly, and Asif lived with constant worry about patient safety.

"I was worried more than anything because I was rushing—rushing to check, rushing to bag. I was worried I was going to make a mistake, and inevitably, mistakes did happen."

In this competitive environment, if the pharmacy didn't meet patient demands, patients would simply go down the road to another pharmacy. The pressure was relentless, and the safety risks were mounting.

## How they did it

**Products used in this study:** Titan PMR

### 1. Built Safety into Every Step

Titan transformed safety by building it directly into the workflow. Barcode scanning prevents wrong products from reaching patients. If it's the wrong product, staff simply won't get a bag label. Every item is tracked with batch numbers and expiry dates. If staff miss a product, the system won't let them seal the bag.

"All those fears are gone. I have no fears about what my staff are doing because I know everything is being scanned. If it's the wrong product, they simply won't get a bag label."

This tracking system has proven invaluable when patients call questioning whether they received an item. Asif can pull up Titan and show them exactly what was dispensed, by whom, with batch numbers and expiry dates. The system provides definitive proof that eliminates disputes.

"We've had many calls from people who think they haven't received something. I can pull up Titan and show them: it was dispensed by this person, here's the batch number, here's the expiry. It should be a blue box in your bag. Every single time, they've called back to say they found it."

The impact on near misses has been dramatic.

"We would have between five and six near misses a month easily on ProScript. I've had two since we've had Titan—and that's in a year."

The improvement is so significant that Asif jokes about inspector skepticism.

"I'm worried the inspector is going to come in, look at my near misses, and say, 'You can't have only made two mistakes in a year.'"

### 2. Freed 85% of Pharmacist Time

The time savings have been transformative. Asif now checks everything in 30 minutes each morning, plus a quick midday review. He comes in at nine, checks his emails and all clinical scripts, and is done by half past nine. At midday, he quickly reviews any new ones. This routine has freed him from the constant back-and-forth that consumed his entire day.

"From a full nine-hour day down to maybe an hour and a bit at most—85% of my time is pretty much free."

This freed time has fundamentally changed how Asif interacts with patients. He can now sit in his consultation room, do his jobs, and spend meaningful time with patients. This shift is reflected in their Google reviews: people appreciate that he's spending time with them, explaining everything properly, rather than rushing them in and out to get back to checking prescriptions.

### 3. Empowered Staff with Meaningful Work

Titan has transformed staff roles from box-checking to meaningful patient care. Staff now manage their own owings, order stock, and take responsibility for patient outcomes. They seem empowered, with more responsibility. It's not just a number anymore, they have a patient.

"They're doing a lot more, although it might seem like their job is less. But they've taken on more responsibility—meaningful work, as opposed to things that anyone can do."

The system's user-friendliness means new staff can pick it up quickly. Asif recently had four new staff start, and within a week they'd taken to it like a duck to water, proving the system's intuitive design.

### 4. Optimised for Small Pharmacy Constraints

Titan's Single Patient Mode solves a critical constraint for smaller pharmacies: space. This mode is great for pharmacies that don't have the space to line up 20 baskets, yet it still allows efficient workflow.

"Even with single patient mode, you still pick all your items. The good thing is I'm not limited to simply 10 patients. I can pick 30 to 50 patients at a time."

This flexibility means Safy's Chemist can work efficiently despite their physical constraints, picking all items once while managing 30–50 patients in a single batch without needing space for multiple baskets.

### 5. Improved Patient Experience

Patient experience has improved dramatically through automated notifications and precise tracking. Patients get text messages every time their medicine is ready. They come in with their barcode, staff scan it, and gone are the days where people had to flick through all the prescriptions to find a patient's name.

The mobile device shows staff exactly where each item is located: one on shelf S1, one on shelf 7S, one on 10M, and an item in the fridge. Staff won't leave until all of them are scanned, ensuring nothing is missed.

"Touch wood, there's never been a case in a year where a patient's prescription hasn't been found. They've always been where they're supposed to be."

### 6. Eliminated Paper and Costs

Safy's Chemist is now 100% paperless. There's no printing anymore. They simply don't print tokens, short of a controlled drug script. This elimination of paper has transformed their morning routine and cut significant costs.

"We'd order three or four toners a month. Because we do 15,000 items, we'd print off a pile of prescriptions that big in the morning. Someone would sit there going through all the repeats, tearing them, sticking one copy of the repeat to the bag, to the rest of the prescription, then getting through all of them and labelling. That process alone took an hour in the morning. I'm checking quicker than that right now."

The pharmacy no longer fills confidential waste bins as quickly, and the time savings from eliminating this manual process are substantial.

## The Results

With Titan, Asif has cut near misses by 97% (5–6/month → 2/year), freed 85% of his time for services, and built a pharmacy where staff take ownership and patients receive better care. The pharmacy is now 100% paperless, with zero lost prescriptions in a year. New patients are choosing the pharmacy based on service quality, and services are expanding: travel, weight loss, earwax, Botox.

"I've recommended Titan to enough other people for it to be genuine when I say this is making a difference. It's changed our pharmacy."

## The Takeaway

Safy's Chemist shows what's possible when safety, efficiency, and staff empowerment are built into the workflow from day one. Even the 80-year-old superintendent loves it.

"Well, if you're in this area and you're thinking about getting Titan, don't get it—stick to paper and the smell of paper. Nothing quite like the smell of paper. Honestly, you're going to miss it. Stick to what you've got. But if you're anywhere else, take the plunge. Honestly, the best thing ever."
