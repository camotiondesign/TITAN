# Scaling Safely Without Robots: Inside Priory Pharmacy's 16K-Item Workflow

Located in the heart of Orpington, Priory Pharmacy is a modern, high-volume pharmacy committed to delivering safe, efficient, and patient-first care. Since taking over the business in 2021, pharmacist and owner Prab has transformed Priory into a fully digital, service-led operation, dispensing nearly 16,000 items every month without robotic automation or overtime. With a lean team and a clear focus on clinical services, Priory Pharmacy has become a model for calm and scalable community pharmacy, powered by intelligent design and modern tools.

## The Challenge

When Prab took over the pharmacy in 2021, the volume wasn't huge. But the way things worked just wasn't built to grow. Everything was manual, systems didn't talk to each other, and the whole setup relied on constant pharmacist intervention.

"Five years ago, I would not be able to be having this conversation with you. I'd probably still be in my dispensary trying to check hundreds of baskets, being incredibly stressed and just not really enjoying pharmacy."

Trying to scale that way wasn't just hard. It was a fast track to burnout.

## How they did it

**Products used in this study:** Titan PMR, Titan AI, Titan Batch Flow, Titan Mobile

### 1. A PMR Built into the Blueprint

Prab's first decision was to install Titan, and redesign the physical layout around it.

"As soon as I took over on day one, I knew that I did not want to have any other PMR other than Titan in here."

"Everything in the pharmacy has a flow. So in the back here, we've got space for our deliveries to go out… everything goes from the front all the way to the back."

The team uses five batch flow workstations, allowing them to work on up to 150 baskets at once. Everything is tracked in real time on Titan's Kanban board.

"So as soon as someone walks into the pharmacy, we know exactly at what stage their prescription's at, due to the Kanban boards on the Titan sort of system."

### 2. Letting AI Handle the Routine

At the heart of the system is Titan AI, which automates the bulk of clinical checking.

"The AI is currently checking and clearing about 70% of the prescriptions that we receive. So the volume that I need to review and check is really small."

"If someone's going thinking about getting Titan, I would just tell them — just sign straight away. It's going to make a huge difference to your working life, and it's going to allow you to grow your pharmacy business, and also allow you to deliver the services that the NHS want in the future."

This intelligent delegation gives Prab the time to focus on services, prescribing, and leading the team.

"Thanks to Titan PMR, I'm probably still in community pharmacy. Otherwise I would have left a long time ago."

### 3. Faster, Smarter Collections with Titan Mobile

No more searching shelves or guessing bag locations. With Titan Mobile, collection is simple.

"We literally have a Titan Mobile device that we have on the front counter… he shows me his collection code… it tells me straight away where his prescription is."

"Patients often get a text while they're out walking the dog, and they pop in and it's just ready."

Titan Mobile links directly to the dispensary, showing bag status, notes, and patient instructions in real time.

### 4. Prioritising Prescriptions in Real Time

Using Titan's tagging and smart queue tools, the team triages work efficiently and fast-tracks what matters most.

"We can actually prioritise prescriptions in the queue… highlight it as waiting… if we know they're coming today, you can mark them as they're coming today."

"Sometimes patients come from the GP surgery and the prescription is already ready, because the system's highlighted that Mr. Jones has now got an antibiotic."

"Everything should have a place and a flow through the pharmacy."

## The Results

With Titan as the foundation, Priory Pharmacy has scaled with confidence and without chaos.

- 16,000 items dispensed monthly
- 70% of prescriptions clinically checked by Titan AI
- No late nights or overtime checking
- Live status updates with Titan Mobile
- Real-time triage of urgent scripts
- Fully paperless, patient-first workflows

"At the moment, we're doing nearly 16,000 items, and we do this without a robot. There's no chaos. Everything's really calm and really organised."

## What's Next: Robots, Prescribing, and Titanverse

With a Meditech robot now being installed and IP services expanding, the next chapter for Priory Pharmacy is already underway.

"I kind of see having the robot with Titan as more of an evolutionary step rather than revolutionary… it's been thought of as part of the process."

"My focus is going to be fully detaching myself away from the dispensing process… and doing a lot more prescribing."

Titan will continue to play a central role in that evolution, including future support through Titanverse, which Prab has already tested.

"I've been lucky enough to kind of see the prototype… I think it's going to be incredible. It's going to really disrupt the market once again."

## The Takeaway

Prab's journey shows what's possible when a pharmacy builds with intention. Not around legacy systems or workarounds, but around clarity, control, and clinical freedom.

"Titan is efficient, it's safe, and it lets us be patient centric without burning out the team or myself."
