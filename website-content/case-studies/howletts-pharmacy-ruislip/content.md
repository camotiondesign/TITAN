# From Chaos to Calm: Howletts Pharmacy Proves Digital-First Can Be Human-First

Howletts Pharmacy in Ruislip is a community pharmacy built on calm, clarity and care. Under superintendent and owner Pritee, the team dispenses around 6,500 items per month, runs a busy post office, and delivers both NHS and private services. Since switching to Titan, the pharmacy has gone fully digital, built a safer, calmer workflow, and created space for staff to upskill and patients to receive more time and attention.

## The Challenge

Before Titan, Howletts Pharmacy was running on paper-heavy, manual systems that consumed staff time and kept Pritee tied to the bench. End-of-month claims could take days, accuracy checks piled up on the workbench, and staff were bogged down in repetitive processes.

The setup limited growth, delayed services, and created unnecessary stress for both pharmacists and dispensers. For Pritee, the aim was to redesign the business into a digital-first, service-led pharmacy where the team could work calmly, efficiently, and with confidence.

## How they did it

**Products used in this study:** Titan PMR, Titan AI, Batch Flow, Repeat Flow

### Building Calm into the Workflow

"The whole team works in a calm manner. We work with each other, communicate with each other, and obviously the technology we have in place helps us oversee what's going on much more easily."

"We don't look chaotic anymore, because the systems allow us to see where we're at at each point. I can be stuck in the room for two three hours without stressing about what's going on out there."

Titan gave Pritee visibility across every stage of dispensing. Patients no longer see staff rummaging through baskets — they get clear answers, quickly.

### AI and Barcode Scanning

"The functions that I love most about Titan that we could not live without now are the ability to scan and use that scanning function to accuracy check most of our prescriptions… and the second is the AI function. I have Titan X on as soon as I walk in, and it will typically check between 50 to 60% of my prescriptions, sometimes more."

"If I look at it from a pharmacist point of view, I would probably be saving on a weekly basis, I think definitely, about 10 hours a week on time spent just checking, possibly more."

Barcode scanning has removed the stress of accuracy checks, while Titan AI ensures the dispensary never stalls.

### Faster Flow for a Leaner Team

"With Batch Flow you're saving about 20 to 30% of your dispensing time, and it's amazing. The staff love it."

"Repeat Flow… has saved a lot of manual labour putting in repeats and chasing up what's missing."

"As a team, we're probably saving four or five hours a day checking and hunting down things. It makes it a more efficient process overall."

By redesigning processes around Titan, the pharmacy can now do more with the same headcount — without adding pressure.

### Services Doubled, Staff Upskilled

"Apart from the last month, we've been hitting about 60 to 70 BP checks a month, because they're freer to fit that in alongside all the other jobs they're required to do."

"We've gone from maybe one private consultation a month to seeing two or three a day."

"Now we have a less stressful environment. We get all the jobs done, plus more, but the staff are now free to help with other services… they do earwax removal for me, they do all the BP checks, they help with the ABPMs, and I just monitor the results."

Titan has unlocked new revenue streams and allowed Pritee to invest in her staff — creating a more rewarding workplace while growing income.

### A Team-First Ethos

"Technology is wonderful, but it can't replace people. Titan frees my staff up to be there for the community — and that's what matters most."

"I can walk away from this dispensary for two, three months, and I know I'll come back to it running just as smoothly, because they take pride in their work and they want to do well by not just me as the boss, but to the community."

For Pritee, Titan is not just about efficiency — it's about trust, teamwork, and giving patients the human connection that defines community pharmacy.

## The Results

- ✅ 6,500+ items dispensed monthly
- ✅ 50–60% of prescriptions clinically checked by Titan AI
- ✅ 20–30% dispensing time saved with Batch Flow
- ✅ 10+ hours a week saved on pharmacist accuracy checks
- ✅ 60–70 blood pressure checks a month (up from 10–15)
- ✅ From 1 private consultation a month → 2–3 every day
- ✅ End-of-month claims done in minutes, not days
- ✅ Calmer environment, reduced errors, safer outcomes

## The Takeaway

Howletts Pharmacy shows what happens when a digital-first approach is paired with a strong, human-first ethos. Titan powers the background, but Pritee's leadership and team culture make the difference.

"Ultimately we're here to make sure we work safely. Efficiency is one part of it, but safety is the biggest part. Titan allows us to free our people up to be there for the community."
