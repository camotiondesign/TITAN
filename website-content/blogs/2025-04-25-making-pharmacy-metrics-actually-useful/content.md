# Drowning in PMR Data? Here's how smart teams cut through the noise

Data surrounds pharmacy teams — but not all of it helps.

If your PMR dashboard feels more like a wall of noise than a helpful tool, you're not alone.

Let's explore what pharmacy performance metrics matter, what you can safely ignore, and how smart pharmacies are simplifying the way they work.

## The Problem With PMR Data Overload

You log into your PMR system. The screen fills with alerts, numbers, and warnings:

- Prescription volumes
- Queue times
- EPS rejections
- Stock shortages
- Safety alerts
- Backlog reports
- Dispensing targets
- Service counts

Most of it? Overwhelming. And worse — it's not always actionable.

"Pharmacists aren't short on data — they're short on time. What they need is clarity. Not just more dashboards, but better ones." — Wahid Muhammad, CTO at Titan

The truth is that many PMR systems were designed to report up to the head office, rather than support day-to-day pharmacy decisions.

## What Metrics Matter in Pharmacy?

Let's cut through the clutter. These are the pharmacy performance metrics that reflect how well you're operating:

- ✅ Time to dispense – Are items being processed quickly and safely?
- ✅ Service output – Are you delivering what's needed (e.g. Pharmacy First)?
- ✅ Label accuracy – Are mistakes being flagged before they hit the bench?
- ✅ Team workload – Is your system removing admin or adding to it?
- ✅ Collection rates – Are patients picking up on time, or is stock building up?

When these move in the right direction, your pharmacy operates more efficiently, your team has the space to breathe, and your patients experience the benefits.

## Which Stats You Can Ignore (Seriously)

Some numbers may seem urgent, but without context, they can simply create stress:

- ❌ Scripts per hour – Without complexity or staffing context, it's a vanity metric
- ❌ Every EPS rejection – Spot trends, not one-offs
- ❌ Big chain benchmarks – You're not Tesco Pharmacy. You have different pressures
- ❌ Daily performance dips – Trends matter more than daily blips

Innovative pharmacy management is about consistency, not constant correction.

## How Smart Pharmacies Track What Counts

Here's how modern, digital-first pharmacies are changing the way they work with data — and how Titan helps support that shift.

### 1. Set goals that reflect real-world success

Instead of chasing "more scripts per hour," forward-thinking teams focus on outcomes like:

- Reducing queue time by 30%
- Increasing services delivered per shift
- Cutting label reprint rates
- Freeing up pharmacist time for consultations

Titan helps teams track progress and visualise performance improvements over time — not just day by day.

### 2. Use dashboards the whole team can understand

Most PMRs are designed for management reports.

Titan flips that, making key workflow data visible and actionable for every role:

- 📋 Dispenser – sees what's ready and what's urgent
- 🧠 Pharmacist – sees flagged clinical risks
- 🧾 Counter staff – see what's due for collection

All in real time — no spreadsheets, no confusion.

### 3. Surface what matters — and automate the rest

You don't need more alerts. You need smarter ones. Titan highlights what needs action:

- 🧠 Titan AI flags clinical risks before they hit the label
- 🕒 Delayed collections are automatically flagged
- 📍 Missing services get prompted for review

No more dashboard babysitting.

### 4. Make every action safer and faster

With Titan's barcoding and mobile tools, safety checks are built into the workflow:

- ✅ Dispensers scan packs — label only prints if the match is right
- ✅ Counter staff scan patient QR codes — instantly see what's ready
- ✅ No printing. No stickers. No back-and-forth

It's a system designed around the way pharmacies work — not just what looks good on a report.

## Final Thought: You Don't Need More Numbers — You Need the Right Ones

Pharmacy teams aren't asking for more data.

They're asking for help:

- ✅ Help identifying bottlenecks
- ✅ Help delivering more services
- ✅ Help reducing risk while saving time

Legacy systems expect you to think.

Titan was built to think with you.

So next time your PMR screen fills up with figures, ask yourself:

Is this data helping me move forward — or just slowing me down?

Because clarity isn't just convenient — it's critical.
