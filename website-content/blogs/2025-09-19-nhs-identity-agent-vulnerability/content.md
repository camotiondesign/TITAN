# NHS Identity Agent vulnerability

NHS England has identified a medium-severity service vulnerability affecting all previous versions of the NHS Identity Agent, including v2.4.6.0. This software is developed and maintained by the NHS and is used by many pharmacies to facilitate smartcard authentication. To mitigate this issue, NHS England requires all organisations to upgrade to NHS Identity Agent v2.4.10.0 by 12 October 2025. Earlier versions have now been formally retired. While this vulnerability does not affect Titan PMR systems directly, we are supporting the NHS England request by encouraging all customers to complete the upgrade as soon as possible to ensure continued access and compliance. To ensure uninterrupted access, please:

1. Download and run the NHS Identity Agent upgrade tool: [https://invatechhealth.com/IAUpgrade.zip](https://invatechhealth.com/IAUpgrade.zip)
2. Go to your Downloads folder
3. Open the IAUpgrade folder
4. Double-click to run IA Upgrade
5. Click More Info > Run Anyway
6. Say Yes to the User Account Control prompt
7. Enter your ODS code
8. The tool will automatically check your installed version and upgrade it if necessary.

We recommend completing this update as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to your NHS services.
