# From Vision to 1000 Pharmacies: The Transformative Journey of Titan PMR

In July 2025, we hit a milestone: our 1000th pharmacy went live on Titan.

We marked the moment with confetti, cake, and a lot of gratitude.

Looking back, it made us reflect on where this all started. And why we built Titan in the first place.

## It started with frustration.

A system that didn't work.

A business held hostage by clunky software.

And a pharmacist who decided that enough was enough.

In 1999, Tariq Muhammad was running a growing group of pharmacies. Every time an item went missing, every time the system failed to track stock, he felt it. Money lost. Time wasted. Patients underserved.

When system suppliers wouldn't listen, he made a decision that changed everything: he started building.

From internal stock systems to home delivery software, the early days weren't glamorous. But they were purposeful. And that purpose never changed: to give pharmacists more control, more freedom, and better tools to do the job well.

## A System Born in the Dispensary, Not the Boardroom

By 2018, what had begun as internal tools had evolved into something much larger.

Titan PMR launched as a concept at the Pharmacy Show. A system built by pharmacists, for pharmacists. Designed not for generic IT specs, but for real workflows, real patients, and real pressures.

The vision was bold: remove friction, automate intelligently, and release the pharmacist from the checking bench.

Titan secured NHS EPS accreditation in 2019, the first new accreditation in over a decade. And it hit the ground running.

Fast-forward to 2025. Titan now processes over twelve percent of the UK's prescription volume. And that number is growing.

## The 1000th Pharmacy: More Than a Number

In July 2025, Titan went live in its 1000th pharmacy: May + Thomson Pharmacy in Woking. A family-run business, rooted in its community for over 40 years.

Also, a pharmacy was completely rebuilt for the future.

Led by Superintendent Pharmacist Sunil Chandarana, the pharmacy combines personalised care with digital-first operations. It's a site that reflects the values Titan was built around: clarity, confidence, and care.

The site features a Meditech robot fully integrated with Titan. One system coordinating both staff and robot with precision — a real-world proof of what's possible when systems are designed to work together.

The celebration was simple. Confetti, cake, and conversation.

But beneath it was something bigger.

A shared belief that pharmacies can be better.

And that together, we're already making it so.

## A Product of Vision, Dedication, and Teamwork

One person never built Titan.

It was shaped by a team that shared the same belief:

Pharmacy deserves better.

The foundations of Titan PMR were laid through years of behind-the-scenes work — long hours, countless iterations, and a relentless focus on solving real-world pharmacy problems.

At the heart of it were five people:

- Tariq Muhammad, founder and CEO. He knew exactly how broken legacy systems were, because he used them himself. When nothing on the market worked, he decided to build something better.
- Wahid Muhammad, Chief Technology Officer, who wrote the original CAPA system line by line. The first dispensing label was printed on 11 September 2001, just days after he handed in his final university assignments.
- Jeff Shelley, now Chief Information Officer. He brought deep technical knowledge and a decade in pharmacy IT. Jeff helped turn Tariq's vision into scalable, safe, intuitive software.
- Hooman Ghalamkari, Chief Operating Officer. With years of experience across care homes and pharmacies, he made sure Titan worked in real-life pressure, with real teams, and real patients.
- Sajid Ramzan, Chief Sales Officer. He led the charge on growth. Out in the field every day, helping pharmacy owners leap with confidence.

Together with our wider team of developers, designers, account managers, support staff and pharmacy partners, they built more than software.

They built a movement focused on clarity, efficiency, and pharmacy-led progress.

Titan is a product of belief, grit, and hundreds of decisions made with one goal in mind:

To make the UK pharmacy work better.

## Built to Interoperate, Not Isolate

Titan isn't just a PMR. It's the digital backbone of a modern pharmacy.

From barcode scanning and mobile access to batch dispensing, AI-led clinical checks and robotic workflows, Titan streamlines what matters and removes what doesn't.

Titan connects with leading robots, patient apps, delivery tools, and service providers. Because in the real world, no one system does it all. However, one system can make everything else work more effectively.

## What's Next? Private Services, Remote Models, and Titanverse

The next chapter of pharmacy isn't just about volume.

It's about value.

Titan is already powering new models, from paperless, mobile-first operations to private service expansion and hybrid working for pharmacists.

Titanverse, our upcoming platform, will enable pharmacies to diversify into private services at scale. It will support patient bookings, remote consultations, and new service layers that give community pharmacies a powerful new role in UK healthcare.

The pressures on pharmacy are real.

But so are the opportunities.

Titan's mission remains the same: give pharmacies the digital tools they need to thrive.

## 1000 Pharmacies. And Still Building.

This milestone belongs to every pharmacy that took a leap with us.

Every team that shared feedback.

Spotted bugs.

Challenged our thinking.

Helped shape what Titan is today.

Titan didn't start with a slick pitch deck.

It started with a pharmacist and a problem.

And today, it powers the kind of pharmacy we all want to see more of.

To everyone who's been part of the journey — thank you.

Here's to the next 1000.

We're just getting started.
