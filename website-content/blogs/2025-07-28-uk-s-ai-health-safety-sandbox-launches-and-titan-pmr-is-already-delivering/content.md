# UK's AI Health Safety Sandbox Launches and Titan PMR Is Already Delivering

In July 2025, the UK took a bold step toward becoming a global leader in safe, regulated AI for healthcare. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) launched Phase 2 of the AI Airlock, a regulatory sandbox designed to test AI medical tools safely. Alongside this, NHS England published its 10-Year Health Plan, setting out a vision to make the NHS the most AI-enabled healthcare system in the world.

While the national strategy is just beginning, Titan PMR has already been delivering results in live pharmacies since 2021.

## What the AI Airlock Means for Health AI

The AI Airlock is a controlled testing environment where developers and regulators can evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AI tools before they reach patients.

Phase 2, announced in June 2025, includes a £1 million investment and opens the door to a wider range of health technologies.

The UK also now leads the HealthAI Global Regulatory Network, shaping international standards for safety and transparency in AI healthcare.

This shows a clear direction from the UK government: make AI safer, faster to deploy, and more trusted.

## The NHS Vision for AI in Healthcare

The new 10-Year NHS Plan outlines a major digital shift, aiming to reduce admin, improve clinical accuracy, and give staff more time with patients.

Plans include integrated patient records, AI-powered support tools for GPs, and digital-first models of care.

The ambition is not to experiment with AI but to embed it into everyday care where it improves outcomes and reduces workload.

This isn't future talk. It's policy backed by real investment and infrastructure.

## Titan PMR is Already Delivering on That Vision

While many are still preparing for AI, Titan PMR has been live in UK pharmacies since 2021. It is not a proof of concept or pilot; it is proven, NHS-accredited, and currently in use in high-volume pharmacies across the UK.

Here's what it does:

- ✅ NHS-accredited AI completing 40-point clinical checks in seconds — Titan scans and verifies prescriptions automatically, saving time and increasing safety.
- ✅ Dosage issues flagged before they become risks — No waiting for a second pair of eyes. Titan spots problems in real time.
- ✅ Pharmacists spend more time with patients — By taking care of the checks, Titan gives pharmacists their time back to focus on services, conversations, and care.

This is not just a PMR. It's intelligent infrastructure for the next generation of pharmacy.

## Real Results: Brighton Hill Pharmacy
