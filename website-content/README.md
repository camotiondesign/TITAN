# Website content

Canonical copies of published Titan website content for reference, tagging, and reuse (social, email, campaigns).

## Folders

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **blogs** | Published blog posts (titanpmr.com/blog/...). Each has `meta.json` + `content.md`. |
| **case-studies** | Pharmacy case studies (e.g. Safy's Chemist). Each has `meta.json` + `content.md`, with stats and outcomes. |

## Use for tagging and reuse

- **Tagging:** Edit `meta.json` → `tags` in any blog or case study so content is easy to find.
- **Search:** Grep or search under `website-content/` by title, slug, pharmacy name, or tag.
- **Reuse:** Reference `content.md` or sections when drafting LinkedIn posts, emails, or follow-up pieces.
