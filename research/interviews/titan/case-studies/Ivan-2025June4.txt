Hi, Ivan, hi, yeah. We are Rexel chemist today, and we are implementing Titan.

Unknown Speaker  0:07  
So how you getting with Titan? So far,

Speaker 2  0:08  
it's been really good. So far with the training, I've been able to sort of use it with easel, use it easily, and been able to, like, follow the instructions, and I can see how it works. It's been really good seeing the visibility of where each prescription is in each stage. So when a prescription when a patient comes in, it's been really easy to find that and get it checked and out to the patient ASAP.

Speaker 1  0:32  
So the process has been quicker. Now, you know, have to wait for the pharmacy to check you're able to pick label and package, yeah? So stress speed for your pharmacist, yeah, definitely. What has been your best feature so far?

Speaker 2  0:45  
My best feature so far is for me, because I manage the stock ordering. It's the visibility of all the Owings on one page and seeing where they are, and being able to update the status and for each item so that entire team can see where it's coming from. So it's not just me. And really beneficial for

Speaker 1  1:04  
me is tried to use batch flow today. Yeah, how did you find it super

Speaker 2  1:08  
handy being able to pick, you know, eight prescriptions all in one go, and then assign them to their own baskets, and then getting those checked into the system quickly and then bagged quickly, and then out for deliveries or out to the patients. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:21  
so they take day two today on Titan. Do you miss the old PMR system so far? You don't want to go back to it?

Unknown Speaker  1:28  
No, I'm quite happy with Titan. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:31  
thank you. Thank you.
