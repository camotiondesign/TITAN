Hi, bum, hi, hello. So we're on site today our vexil chemist doing Titan training. So why did you choose Titan?

We chose Titan because it was getting to a stage where our clinical work, through our services, was being really compromised by the level of dispensing work that we had, so we had to find a different way of working.

Can you see the potential in title for your pharmacy?

Speaker 2  0:29  
Yes, we can. So the other day, I was able to have four or five long consultations with patients without having to worry about prescriptions being checked.

Unknown Speaker  0:39  
What's the best features of I

Speaker 2  0:42  
think the ability to be able to check a prescription allows somebody else to complete it without having to completely bag it and finish it we start to finish that allows our customers to get what they need and leave, whilst allowing me to focus on patients with more complex needs. Fantastic.
