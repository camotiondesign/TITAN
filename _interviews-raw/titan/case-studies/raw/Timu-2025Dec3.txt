Hi, Timu, Hello. We are using batch flow today. Yes, how you finding it's going well. It's going well like in the flow, off it? Yes, we did 20 baskets today, maximum. We've got all the baskets numbered up there. Yeah, making a bit difficult to reach. But we'll sort that out later. But do you see how quick it was, picking, labeling and bagging? Really quick. It was really quick compared to what you were doing the morning, one patient at a time. Would you use it again? Most definitely. Yeah, it will make my work easy. You can see the potential in it. Yeah, sure. Fantastic. I.
