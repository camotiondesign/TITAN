Hi. Yusuf, hi. Which number pharmacy is this now? Because I lost count, this is number 11. Oh, okay, so we are at night street pharmacy. Can I see the Titan hoodie? Yeah, you're quite popular with Titan at the moment. Anyway, yeah, all over Nick,

Unknown Speaker  0:20  
how was your implementation today?

Speaker 2  0:22  
Really good. Really good. We decided this time we were going to do it on a quiet day. Just to give what day of the week is it? It's on a Saturday today, giving the staff as much time behind closed doors to be able to understand time on it without the phone ringing, without patients walking through the door, went head on with batch flow, making sure that they understood the process, set up the entire Dispensary for that. And it's been quicker because

Speaker 1  0:51  
of it. Batch flow on the first date, good idea.

Speaker 2  0:54  
Yes, definitely it's been in terms of workflow, we've been able to tailor the workflow for it got people picking specifically to the pick sheet. People just there, standing there, getting the dispensing done. And that way we're getting more done in a short

Speaker 1  1:08  
period of time. And we're doing batches of 20s. We've done quite a few now, separating

Speaker 2  1:12  
collections and deliveries. So workflow is quite orderly and well organized. Okay?

Speaker 1  1:17  
And you set up all the pieces everything last night. Does that make a difference?

Speaker 2  1:22  
It does. Making sure your equipment is working beforehand calibrated, making sure the printers are all set up and everything can communicate with each other, that's key. Good day so far. Really good day. Good help from you. All the stuff definitely asked you lots of questions to make sure that anything that they needed to know you wanted

Speaker 1  1:41  
fabulous, Yep, thank you so much. Thank you.
