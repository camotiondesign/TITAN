Hi, Sean, hi, you're the pharmacist here today. I am. Yeah. So how you getting on with Titan? I'm enjoying it. I'm only here once a week, and so each time I come in, I love a little bit more. But I've had, I've had lots of stuff explained to me today by nerve which has been really helpful, just shortcuts and things which has made it all easier. So does it help? Having a trainer on site definitely makes a difference business. Yeah. So would you recommend at the pharmacies? I would Yeah. What's your best feature so far in Titan? I quite like, I liking the quick check because and the quick packaging, and I've worked out the way to do a quick check before doing the quick packaging, which makes it all a little bit faster. There's various things that I'm sure I'm going to find along the way as well. And just to say that features only be used by the pharmacist, not by the dispenser. Yes, yeah, which I clarified with you, because that was just one concern that I had. But yeah, yeah, you're using titanx, yes. How you finding it? It's really good. It's really slick, it's quite intuitive. And having had more stuff explained again, I realized that they can do more than I thought, more. And does it free up a lot your time? Well, yes, I think it does. That does okay. We just need to get a system and a workflow in. I think that's that's probably our main issue at the moment, but a workflow would be helpful. Do you miss the old PMR system? No. Huffy, Yep, thank you. Bye.
