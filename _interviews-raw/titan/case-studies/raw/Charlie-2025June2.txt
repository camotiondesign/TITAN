Hi, Charlie and you Hello. So we did Titan training today. Yeah, how you getting on? Really well, really been smooth, and I really enjoyed it, and I learned so much. So is anything new that you have learned today that will make a difference? Yes, I've learned how to shelf audit now, which is really easy, and then I've learned how to access your battery for people and how to you can release multiple as well that make it easier if people on holiday. So yeah, this is going really well. Which PMR were you using before? Sedi gym? Do you miss it? No, not at all. This is great. I love it. It's so much easier. And yeah, I just yeah, I'm really happy with it. And having me on site today, giving you training. Did you make a difference? Oh, 100% I actually can't believe how much, but I didn't know, and just how much more now, but I know, and it's just easy. I feel like we can do this now. Thank
