My name is Yusuf. I'm the head of pharmacy for BNP healthcare. BNP healthcare, we first started with the branch we're in today. Back in 2017 started with one branch, and some opportunities came around to get one of the biggest pharmacies in the country down in Spaulding, called westella Pharmacy. We have around 150 staff across all of our branches. And items wise, we are doing about 170,000 a month across all of our branches. Our directors are Rahul and Anup, really, really, really passionate about services, really passionate about patient care. So Titan, I've known Saj and I've known some of the guys a long time in previous pharmacies that I've had myself. And you know, Pharmacy at the time worked differently. Everyone was sort of chasing items. It was all about get more items. All of our stores use proscript. Proscript was very much about efficiency with prescriptions. And it was in 2023 we went to the pharmacy show. We knew the pharmacy was changing, and at that time, Titan were the only ones who actually knew pharmacy were changing and sharing us stuff that we knew we needed to be a part of, but we knew that was the way we needed to go, and we knew that Titan was going to be that platform. Put it in one of our smaller stores to start with, but six months later, we were adding on a branch a month. So imagine using proscript, quick and efficient for labeling, very, very good in terms of accuracy, but at the end of it, I've got a mountain to check as a pharmacist, not all stores have the luxury of having checking technicians. Ultimately, the pharmacist has still got to stand there checking those prescriptions. And the key thing for us, we were able to now take that pharmacist out of the dispensary. Now you'll find that the pharmacist is planted inside their consultation room, and that's where they should be. And Titans allowed us to do that. But also, what other PMRs didn't allow was the accuracy with the labeling and the assembling process, there is always that element of human error, because it's a manual pick, even with a robot, you're pulling out an item and you're fixing a label, are you putting it on the right box? There's always that element of doubt when anything is being done manual with barcode scanning that is being completely taken out the picture, the staff have to follow a strict process. Now the barcode scanning is massive. Imagine now that knowing that no matter who has assembled it, as long as they follow the process, you've put in place one label at a time, one box at a time, you've completely eliminated the ability to make that error, and no other PMR at that time would have allowed you to do that. I mean, we'll just take any typical branch that doesn't have an AC T. I'm doing 100% of the checking, and that's That's just fact in any of our branches now, with Titan, a pharmacist who isn't working with any AC T or any checking dispenser, your checking is down to probably between 20 30% which is which is a massive change in time of needed to be in the dispensary. Obviously, when we use proscript, someone has to affix a label to a box. That's a manual process. And even if you've got a robot, it's churning out multiple items at a time, and you're having to fix an item to each one now with the barcode scanning and with it down to one item, one label at a time, there's a massive reduction in that human error. It's auditable. You're able to be you'll be able to see the time, the batch number, the expiry date, individually scanned it. And that's all because it's a strict process, and because of that, there is full confidence that once that clinical check is done, that the right item, the right dosage, the right strength, everything is going to be with that patient. And the best, the best thing about it is, is the ability to audit that everything, when all staff have to adhere to a strict process, user logins, smart card entry and everything, and with the ability to be tracing, barcode scanning of each individual item, the batch number, the expiry, it tells you who's done it. If there is ever a problem which we haven't really had, to a degree, it's all auditable down to the person. So it's pretty incredible for me. I've seen Titan from from day one. I've been to the pharmacy show every year for the past 10 years. And there was a time where I looked at it and I thought, it's not quite ready. It's not quite ready yet. There's going to be bugs. It's in its infancy. And I keep going back to 2023, and then when I saw it at that point, I realized, now that they were ready, it is, it was going to be. It's not about it being playing with the big boys. You know, you still got the big boys out there, but the big boys think old school. And ultimately, I knew that this was the correct process and it was going to be. Moving forward, and the more and more feedback I had from individuals as well, there aren't any. There is no other PMR company out there that allows its users to consider new innovative updates and new features and implements them as quick as Titan does. So many times using canny, we've put suggestions through of updates and things that help workflow. And I mean, I'm not even exaggerating, within a month, they're normally done. It's in the next update that you get on Titan. They're so open, because they know that the pharmacists are the best best place to be able to determine what is going to be best for the process, what is going to work best for all pharmacists, and they've got the right people on board, because everyone who's got Titan right now is forward thinking, what is the best way and what what is the best way for my pharmacy to operate? Where am I best going to be placed, and what does my PMR need to do to be able to let me do that? How many companies do you know out there have a WhatsApp group with the software developer, the head of sales, the owner, all in that group, listening to everyone's suggestions and things like that. It doesn't happen. It doesn't happen anywhere in any industry. There's not one software provider that will do that in the pharmacy industry, other than Titan. The values need to align. Titan, from what I can see, and everything I've seen so far is of a family oriented company. We are a family orientated independent pharmacy chain. From the top, it's two brothers and one one of their wives as directors, all pharmacists, all work in the branches. All know every single staff. There's 150 staff. We know every single one of their names, and they know us. And in any other company of this organizational size, you can't say that that would be the case from the top to bottom, everyone knows each other well. If you were to walk into our pharmacy at a busy hour, you probably feel like you walked into the checkout at Tescos, because all you hearing is beeping, which means everyone's following the process, no override. Everyone's scanning the boxes, everyone's scanning the labels. And that's what you want to hear. You'd notice that probably the pharmacist isn't even in the dispensary. Is the main thing. The whole point of this is, is that I've got my pharmacist in that consultation room, and that's where I want them to be. You'll see, in terms of workflow, the store we're in today actually does have a robot, so it works slightly differently to other ones that pick with batch, flow and things like that. But you're to sound a little bit funny. You sounds like Tesco. All you're hearing is beeping, non stop scanning, scan, scan. And that's what I want to hear, because it means that everyone's following the process, no one's overriding anything, and everyone's doing what they should be doing. Everything felt a little bit more chaotic. To a degree. It was organized chaos, but a little bit more chaotic, in the sense that with the Titan board, there is a clear workflow. The prescriptions are in date order. They're tagged very easily to see whether it's deliveries, if we're doing dosset, if we're doing a particular care home, is very easy to see. It's very easy to organize the workload. If we look at how it used to be, I would just see prescriptions on the screen, a name and a date, not really easily able to configure my workflow to us to a point where one person knew as soon as they came in, right? I'm handling these lots of prescription or how I'm handling this law of prescriptions so it's organized our workflow a lot better on a daily basis. Imagine when a patient comes through the door and you want to be able to find their prescription by simply typing in your name, you know at what stage they're at, instantly has a prescription just come down. Is it still being assembled? Are we waiting for an item to come in from our supplier, or is it simply in that retrieval draw ready to be done and again with our previous PMR, unless it was ready completed, and in a draw, you almost had to do a bit of guesswork to figure out where that would be. And if people hadn't stuck to the process, it could be in a number of places. No more guesswork day to day. What is the most important part of Titan? For me, it's a really tricky one. To be fair, we've already touched about workflow and how the

Speaker 1  9:30  
you know, the screen, the way the dashboard is laid out, makes it easier for all of the staff to be able to come in know exactly what their workflow is for the day. But I think that also the dashboard, the owing screen, it's clearly laid out, telling us exactly what is there. You know, again, previously, it would be down to an owing note people having to chase with suppliers, but they've linked that together. You know, our Owings board has a specific owing screen. We're able to add tags when it's coming in. Who it's coming in with, if it's long term out of stock, and again, we would have to go to multiple screens before to be able to determine that batch flow has been incredible in terms of being able to process multiple prescriptions in one go, and allowing a lot of the thought to be taken out of it, making it more of a monotonous task has meant distractions happen in pharmacy, phone calls patients being needing to be served, orders coming in, but batch flow has allowed you to be able to come away from that, and when you return, you continue with what you're doing without the fear of making a mistake. You scan it tells you what basket to put it in. You affix the label and you put it in. By making it as simple as that, it's probably made it even safer, infinitely more safer, if you if you think of doing multiple prescriptions at one time, without the ability to be told what basket to be putting it in and what label to you know what item, what label to attach. You're talking about making some very serious errors. You know, the pharmacist wouldn't be checking it at the end of it. And here you've got the added safety of when you're bagging it, it will tell you if it's going in the wrong bag, as well any dosage changes that need to be made or recognized from the beginning, whereas, if you imagine checking a prescription at the end, you know, it's been labeled, it's been assembled, you're about to bag it. Oh no, I've got an error on it. I have to go all the way back to the beginning, change the label, put it back on, make sure it's now the right product. Wait a second. Was it the wrong label? Was it the wrong product? Let me check a prescription. How much time have we added in just talking about it, let alone doing it? So by doing it at the start, we've eliminated having to do that. Majority of the PMRs are still doing it. Everyone's sort of tagging on the coattails of Titan these days in terms of barcode scanning and, you know, prescription checking with, you know, using barcode technology, but still, from a workflow perspective, that prescription is still need to be printed and checked at the end. As long as the process of batch flow is followed as it should be, it can probably double the speed of normal dispensing. If I had to quantify what it was like using a previous PMR to how I'm using Titan Now, if I think about how I used to walk in blind, almost to work every single morning, not knowing what sort of workflow I'd have to be dealing with, not knowing if I wasn't in the day before, what I they'd had to deal with. And what I was walking into,

Unknown Speaker  12:43  
at times low stuffing,

Speaker 1  12:47  
you know, sickness and things like that. There is an element of anxiety that can go with it, especially if you're in a really busy store, you know, and that is completely transformed, you know, with the ability to use Titan remotely, using in head office, having pharmacists on hand to be able to help with that workload as well. You know, if I'm in the consultation room and a new prescription comes down that I'm not able to clinically check, they just call our service pharmacist. Our service pharmacist logs in, checks the prescription off, and it's ready to go. I don't even need to be disturbed. Repeat flow is is revolutionary for us. So within most areas now, in the UK, they've eliminated pharmacy, pharmacy, patient, pharmacy, prescription ordering. So what that means is, is that a pharmacy can no longer order regular medication on a patient's behalf, and a patient must order directly from their surgery. Now the exception to that is vulnerable patients, patients who potentially are unable to for whatever reason, and those who are on dosset dosset boxes. Now we have quite a lot of patients that we have on dosset boxes, and it used to be a manual process, you know, you have a repeat. Once it's gone, the patient takes off. If they want anything externally, you file it come the next month, you then need to remember once a year to that date to take it out, create an audit control in the diary, and then put it into the surgery, whether that be by email or physically going down with the driver to put it into the surgery. Repeat flow has basically eliminated that completely. You put it on a cycle, it sends an email off to the surgery. When the prescription returns, it recognizes it from the board. It tells you, it tells you if you need to do any chasing. It tells you if there's been any changes, and you can then put that on to Titan quite easily. It's spectacular. It's on a it's on a monthly cycle. You can easily amend changes. It will just know when to order it for the following month. They automatically sent off. It chases surgeries after three days if they haven't turned the prescription through, because it knows. It hasn't gone through to Titan. It just it made workflow in terms of staff time so much quicker staff definitely in terms of how the staff feel about Titan,

Unknown Speaker  15:12  
if we go back to

Speaker 1  15:14  
in generally human mentality, change is always difficult for a lot of people, especially when you've been using a PMR for so long, and it's not easy to win people over, but Titan empowers the staff to be able to take control of the dispensary. They actually feel like they have more responsibility and more control over it compared to, oh, pharmacist is on lunch. Oh, I need him to check this off. Can you quickly check this off? That's no longer needed a pharmacist can be in the break room having their lunch and a prescription has already been clinically checked, and they come in, they can just get it done. No need to disturb the pharmacist, and out they go. So they feel like they've got a lot more control and empowered. I mean, services in some of our branches were basically non existent before Titan, because of time, because of the checking time that we've already spoken about, if you imagine now that my pharmacist is able to basically sit in that room and have the time and also not be under the stress of knowing the workload is in the dispensary still for them to do. Our services have increased in some branches by 500% even the ones that were doing some services before, because of the ability to come out of the dispensary, they've still increased by at least 300% it's given them the time as well to be able to to do the training for it as well. That's that's been key. You know, we no longer just offer simple travel vaccinations. Or if we take it one step further back, just the time to do simple NHS flu vaccinations before, and covid vaccinations that took up so much time that they'd be under stress, knowing we need to get back into decade or the checking done. And now we're talking about they have the confidence to do travel vaccinations, ear, micro suction, weight, weight management, you know, services like that, they wouldn't have had the confidence to be able to know that they could spend the time to do it. And now, even if a consultation has taken them half an hour on an initiation, they've got the confidence to do it, knowing that the dispensary isn't falling behind. We have a select few branches that have technicians at this time, and they're also doing more and more services now than they ever have been able to. You know, they're able to continue doing contraception, hypertension, case finding service, all these ones before, where you know, more often than not you're finding in our branches, you won't just have one consultation room, and that's because you can do multiple service at one time. UK pharmacy is in a difficult time right now. The way that the government have set up our contractors is almost to a degree, looking to set us up to fail. You know, people talk about having to make cuts with staffing and things like that, and we take a different view on it completely. If we can put in a process and a piece a piece of software or system that can allow us to give our staff more time, rather than having to make us look like we need to reduce our staff, then we will do that, and that's what Titan's allowed us to do. So in the time that we've put in Titan, we haven't reduced our staffing levels. We're retraining our stuff to be able to do different things, like you mentioned before, technicians can do more services, but what also we're able to do is level two dispensers are able to do vaccinations. We've trained them up to do vaccinations because that has allowed the funds to do the private stuff, which a dispenser can't do. So rather than looking to make cut. We're actually looking to improve the capabilities of our stuff, and that's what the route we've gone down. Io such big time. He's he's been asking me to do this for a while.

Speaker 2  18:52  
Perfect assignment. Yeah, it works out really well. But if you like, maybe an opener with if I was to speak to it, as far as to tell a pharmacist. Well, sorry, the question is basically, what would you say to a pharmacist or a pharmacy owner who's think, who's using a different PMR system or thinking about its title?

Speaker 1  19:14  
Yeah, I read that question before. Actually, I was thinking about that, and the first thing I was gonna say is, don't do it. Don't open a pharmacy. But no, someone moving to Titan. Why haven't you already done it yet? No, that's cool. Yeah, I know, but that's gonna get too tick tocky. Is this all for tick tock?

Speaker 2  19:36  
No, it's not. It's actually like a whole funnel. So every on YouTube, okay, mainly to the long form, piece of content, and then it will be like, it will be like some hooky, more hooky material called guy Wash, wash, the longer, yeah, case value, yeah.

Speaker 1  19:53  
So this question that you want to ask, then, are you looking to put it towards it honestly, just honestly. No. So. Because you can pitch it for two different type of people. So you pitching for the guys who work in their pharmacies, day in, day out, or are you pitching it towards the guys who own multiple so within the next six months, using Titan, we're going to be looking at the hub and spoke peer to peer model. Now that we do about 170,000 items, that will be the next step of efficiency for us. You know, Titans already saved us a lot of time across the pharmacist perspective. Now what we want to do is save the staff time, and the best way to do that is centralizing a lot of things. So that will be the next thing we look into. So for me, if I had an individual similar circumstances to us with a few branches, and they were looking to switch, or they were looking to change their PMR. To ask the question, why would Titan be right for us? Well, I would ask them to look at what their current PMR providing them, and I'd ask them to look at what that PMR has changed in the last five years, because if it hasn't changed, and I would ask them how the pharmacy industry has changed in the last five years. I'd ask them why they're still with them at the end of the day, five years ago, or even 10 years ago, the industry was chasing items. We're not chasing items anymore. We're about service. That's what pharmacies should be. And Titan allows you to do that. And I can't say the same for a lot of other PMRs. Yeah, great.

Speaker 2  21:31  
Bad answer. Nice from that. So yeah, we'll sort of move on to the more Titan verse section. Yeah. With this, we can sort of lean on the idea of, like, you know, Titan freed you from the dispensary. Yeah, and because you've done an amazing job of just talking about Titan exclusively there, because we're talking about titanverse, we can't show you that sort of like, because of the ability

Speaker 1  21:50  
cool. So which one did the titanverse questions? So we've been one of the early adopters of a titan verse. As soon as we saw it in the farmers show 2023 I made it quite clear to the guys that I wanted to be one of the first ones to use it, because that, from our model perspective, allowed us to control so much more. So we've been doing it since the NMS module was the first live module, and it allowed us to be able to centralize that to our head office and make it more efficient. Normally, your pharmacist on site would be completing this, or you'd have to hire extra pharmacists to be able to do it. By allowing us to be able to do it all from a central location, we were able to make it more efficient only one pharmacist needed to be able to complete these everything was in one area, the workflow, again, was being able to be it was, it was open for all of our senior management to be able to see, we could see in advance whether we needed to get more people in to create, to be able to complete workload at by a particular time. I think the best thing about it is, is the reporting and the statistics and going forward, with the introduction of being able to use potentially VoIP on there as well. And now the introduction of AI services with private services as well, it's going to be it's going to be amazing, yeah. So we, we started off by using NMS modules, and that allowed us first to get used to it, all of our stuff, to get used to it. And again, being part of the early adoption program, we're able to see all of the services platforms that are now being being put on the AI is literally the greatest thing I've ever seen. I couldn't believe in the even in this day and age now with AI, how easy it is to be able to create templates for each and every service. I'm able to create a questionnaire template for a travel vaccination course, while at the same time, I'm able to create ad hoc even when a patient walks through the door, something for weight loss. I'm able to do it for all of my pharmacy first ones. It's allowed me to basically tailor make each consultation at that time without having to make the patient wait. Now, if you imagine before, when we were doing travel vaccinations, everything was manual, everything was on paper. Once someone had completed their travel risk assessment form, I'd then have to write out a prescription. They would then have to enter onto the PMR as a manual, private prescription, and then they'd have to process it out with titanverse. It's a digital prescription. I'm able to approve it. It goes straight to my board. They dispense it using Titan I don't need to be involved in that and hand it out. It genuinely is amazing with pharmacy first. There are particular pathways that you need to follow in order to get to what is called the gateway criteria. The Gateway criteria is the sweet point by which, if a patient meets that, then you're able to provide them with a particular service on pharmacy first. So whether that be for acute sinusitis or. Or for an acute sore throat, like tontilitis. So those pathways are all basically set out so that you can follow it. You'll be able to see if a patient has any red flag symptoms, so you need to refer or if they meet all the criteria for you to be able to provide that service without Titan, you would literally have had to you would literally have had to have that on your screen to be able to follow it step by step. And it's not that you can't memorize that, but also, you need to make sure that the patient doesn't meet any of the exclusion criteria, and you need to make sure that you haven't accidentally provided something when you shouldn't have by following step by step. When the when it shows you that clinical pathway, it highlights it when you have answered a question the patient has answered using voice transcription. It leaves it open if you haven't, so that you can look back to see actually I haven't asked that question. And then it will tell you whether you've actually they've met that criteria or not. What is the next appropriate thing? Should I be referring this patient, or should I be providing with antibiotics? So once I've done that voice transcription and I've completed that consultation, AI is already giving me suggestions about what next steps should be. So generate a prescription, give these particular vaccinations, and once I put in what I've given, it already automatically generates that prescription. And once it's all completed, it gives me a complete summary of it as well. It summarizes. It gives me a complete transcription of what was actually said in that consultation. It gives me a summary of it. And then on the patient's portal, it gives me their vitals, if I've taken any and entered them on. And I get that snapshot every single time I go back into that patient's record, I know what potentially the last consultation we had was. I know what sort of their vital levels were at if it's going to be significant to that consultation. An example of that is the weight loss. I know what their weight was at that time. I know what their BP was the last time. And it's able to give me a snapshot instantly of whether there'd be an improvement. Imagine before titanverse, we would have been using a booking platform to be able to take the booking of that patient coming in. We would have then been using a manual piece of paper for the patient to do a risk assessment. I'd have been using a manual piece of paper to then write a prescription. I'd have then needed to file that away. I then would have needed to go on to the PMR to enter it in as a prescription. This is all in one place. I only need to go to one place to find where the consultation was on one place to find a prescription. And that's Titan is literally incredible. We may be part of the early adopters, but ever since Tariq and who men did the did the early adopters video webinar a couple of weeks ago. The chat has been insane, and everyone feels exactly how we did that day when we first saw it, and they can't wait to get on it. Imagine having to do a consultation prior to titanverse. So it's almost really impersonal when you think about it. Imagine going to see your GP. You're telling him what's wrong. He's sat there typing away on the computer what you're telling him, almost having to repeat it out, or just keep saying, Hmm, yes, yes. With itemverse, I'm sitting facing the patient, looking at them, having a conversation with them. Yes. I may need to look back every so often to check what the questions were, but because it's picking it all up, I don't need to sit there typing away afterwards. That saved me time during to make it impossible, making a more friendly experience for the patient. And again, where what software, or what multiple softwares, has ever allowed you to do that before? None quality of service that we're not able to provide our patients now using titanverse is second to none since titanverse, and since we've been giving those consultations, as I mentioned, more personable and more friendly face to face, we've definitely seen an increase in uptake. There's been it's been massively highlighted in the news the increase in prices to do with weight loss products, but that hasn't phased our patient, because they appreciate the service that we're giving them. And you know, the likes of the online providers and things like that have not got that personal touch the way we're able to now provide task delegation has been massively, massively helped using titanverse, the again, being early adopters, were able to use the clinical check function as well. And there's been a couple of times, for example, where a

Speaker 1  29:29  
pharmacist is held up in a consultation. You know, we did speak about the efficiencies of Titan and the stuff not having to disturb, but if it's a new prescription still needs clinical checking, turn on the AI. Well, there's a discrepancy that AI knows that it can't just send it straight through. So what do you do in that circumstance? Well, because of titanverse and the clinical check aspect, they had one call to the head office. Pharm system is already on. Titanverse just logs on to that branch, able to send it through, and the staff can get on with it. One thing that we made it very clear when we first started. As early adopters with this is that the AI needed to be learning from the correct resources. And, you know, when it comes to travel vaccinations, well, it can't just be learning from Google. It's got to be learning from reliable resources in the UK, you know, we use we use Nath neck, we use the green book. It's important that we knew that it was a closed system, that we were only entering in the appropriate information to to feed it to learn and you know, the guys at Titan have done amazing to make sure that it's a closed system that's only being fed the appropriate information with titanverse, if you imagine, before having it, you would need to create your own paperwork, create your own risk assessment, vet them, also double check to make sure that they're appropriate to what service you're providing. The fact that Titan versus AI module is able to create that for you on the spot, to a level of detail that even me, who's been doing this service for many years, sometimes thinks, wow, even I sometimes don't think of asking those kind of questions. It's so thorough that it just provides you with the confidence to know that you can provide that service safely and also efficiently. So for someone who is yet to start their clinical services program in their pharmacy or thinking what step they can next take to make it more efficient, Titan versus the answer, no matter what level of experience you had, it still surprised me. I myself have been a prescriber now for three years, but our director has been a prescriber for well over 10 years, and even now, looking at titanverse, it makes you think that, oh, wow, we need to level up her.
