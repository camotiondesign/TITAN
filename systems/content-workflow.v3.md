# Content Workflow v3
**From TITAN x TITANVERSE model to actual posts**

---

## Quick cheat sheet

1. Voice & format – Titan PMR or Titanverse? Carousel, single, or video?  
2. Node – One system role, human state, failure mode, or operating shift.  
3. Hook – First line = number, name, or sharp contrast.  
4. Failure – Name the concrete problem (baskets, hours, near misses).  
5. Cost – Quantify time, stress, money, or opportunity lost.  
6. Unsustainable – Show why this cannot continue, not just why it is hard.  
7. Fix & proof – Show the alternative, name the proof, point to forward motion.

## STEP 1: Voice & Format

**Definition**  
Decide which product world you are in and how this story should be told.

**Question**  
Is this mainly a dispensing story (Titan PMR), a services story (Titanverse), or the bridge between them?

**Micro-prompts**

- Titan PMR: "This is about workflow, safety, and calm in dispensing."  
- Titanverse: "This is about clinics, services, and patient experience."  
- Intersection: "Titan PMR creates capacity. Titanverse turns it into services."

**Format rule of thumb**

- Carousel: transformation, before/after, or multi-step logic.  
- Single image: one sharp idea or blunt position.  
- Video: named person, emotional or visual journey.

Main bias: pattern interruption (format choice) and authority (clear voice).

## STEP 2: Pick the Node

**Definition**  
Choose one element from the systems model to anchor the post.

**Question**  
Which single thing am I really talking about?

**Options**

- System role: pharmacist at bench, pharmacist in clinic, dispenser, owner.  
- Human state: calm, overloaded, trapped, ambitious.  
- Failure mode: manual checking, baskets stacking up, no time for services.  
- Operating shift: items to services, bench to clinic, chaos to calm.

Rule: one post, one node.

Main bias: authority (you look like you understand the system).

---

## STEP 3: Write the Hook

**Definition**  
Open with a line that creates curiosity or contrast, anchored in reality.

**Question**  
What first line would make a tired pharmacist stop scrolling?

**Micro-prompts**

- Number: "16,000 items a month. No chaos."  
- Named person: "Five years ago, Prab was ready to leave pharmacy."  
- Contrast: "From 4,000 items to 17,000. No extra staff."  
- Blunt truth: "Dispensing alone will not pay the bills."

Rules

- First line must contain either a number, a name, or a direct contrast.  
- No soft intros. No scene-setting. Hit straight away.

Biases: curiosity gap, pattern interruption, contrast effect.

---

## STEP 4: Name the Failure

**Definition**  
State what is actually broken, using concrete nouns.

**Question**  
What specific thing is making life impossible here?

**Micro-prompts**

- "Baskets stacking up."  
- "Pharmacists checking 100% of scripts manually."  
- "80% of the day stuck at the bench."  
- "Services squeezed out by dispensing."

Rules

- Talk about baskets, scripts, hours, rooms, not "efficiency" or "challenges".  
- One primary failure per post.

Bias: loss aversion (you make the pain explicit).

---

## STEP 5: Quantify the Cost

**Definition**  
Put a number on the pain: time, stress, money, or opportunity.

**Question**  
If they ignored this problem for a year, what would it cost?

**Micro-prompts**

- Time: "20 pharmacist hours a week at the bench."  
- Safety: "Five or six near misses every month."  
- Opportunity: "No time left for clinics."  
- Emotional: "Ready to leave the profession."

Rule: at least one real number or one very clear "before" state.

Biases: loss aversion, authority (specificity).

---

## STEP 6: Show Why It Cannot Continue

**Definition**  
Make the consequence feel inevitable, not optional.

**Question**  
What breaks if they keep going like this?

**Micro-prompts**

- "This is a fast track to burnout."  
- "Dispensing alone will not sustain this business."  
- "You cannot bolt clinical care onto firefighting."  
- "Scaling items like this just scales risk."

Language pattern: cannot / will not / fast track to, not "might struggle".

Biases: loss aversion, inevitability.

---

## STEP 7: Show the Fix, Prove It, Point Forwards

**Definition**  
Shift the node, show how the system changes, and prove it with a named example.

**Question**  
What does "after" look like, and who has already done it?

**Micro-prompts**

- Fix: "AI clears low-risk scripts so pharmacists step off the bench."  
- Proof: "Prab now runs 16,000 items a month with no overtime."  
- Forward motion: "The time goes into clinics, not firefighting."

Rules

- Always include at least one named person and one concrete outcome.  
- End on what this makes possible next (services, growth, headspace).

Biases: authority, hope, social currency.

## Tiny in-editor checklist

Paste this above your draft and tick mentally as you write:

1. Voice clear? Titan PMR / Titanverse / intersection chosen.  
2. One node picked from the model.  
3. First line = number, name, or sharp contrast.  
4. Failure named in concrete terms.  
5. Cost has at least one real number.  
6. Consequence feels inevitable, not optional.  
7. Fix has named proof and forward motion.
