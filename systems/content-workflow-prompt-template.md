# Content Workflow v3 - Manual Template
**Fill in the blanks to build your caption skeleton**

Use this template when you prefer to work manually or when the interactive script isn't available.

## STEP 1 – Voice & Format

**Voice:** [ ] Titan PMR  [ ] Titanverse  [ ] Intersection

**Format:** [ ] Carousel  [ ] Single image  [ ] Video

**Rationale:**
_Why this voice and format?_


---

## STEP 2 – Pick the Node

**Node type:** [ ] System role  [ ] Human state  [ ] Failure mode  [ ] Operating shift

**Specific node:**
_Describe the one element you're anchoring the post on:_


**Examples:**
- System role: "Pharmacist at bench" → "Pharmacist leading"
- Human state: "Stressed" → "Calm"
- Failure mode: "Manual checking", "Baskets stacking up"
- Operating shift: "Items → services", "Bench → clinic"

---

## STEP 3 – Write the Hook

**Hook (first line):**
_Must contain a number, name, or sharp contrast. No soft intros._


**Check:**
- [ ] Contains a number, name, or contrast
- [ ] Hits straight away (no scene-setting)
- [ ] Would make a tired pharmacist stop scrolling

**Examples:**
- "16,000 items a month. No chaos."
- "Five years ago, Prab was ready to leave pharmacy."
- "From 4,000 items to 17,000. No extra staff."
- "Dispensing alone will not pay the bills."

---

## STEP 4 – Name the Failure

**Failure (concrete problem):**
_Use concrete nouns: baskets, scripts, hours, rooms. Not "efficiency" or "challenges"._


**Check:**
- [ ] Uses concrete nouns (baskets, scripts, hours, rooms)
- [ ] One primary failure only
- [ ] Not abstract language

**Examples:**
- "Baskets stacking up."
- "Pharmacists checking 100% of scripts manually."
- "80% of the day stuck at the bench."
- "Services squeezed out by dispensing."

---

## STEP 5 – Quantify the Cost

**Cost (quantified pain):**
_At least one real number or one very clear "before" state._


**Check:**
- [ ] Contains at least one real number OR very clear "before" state
- [ ] Quantifies time, stress, money, or opportunity

**Examples:**
- Time: "20 pharmacist hours a week at the bench."
- Safety: "Five or six near misses every month."
- Opportunity: "No time left for clinics."
- Emotional: "Ready to leave the profession."

---

## STEP 6 – Show Why It Cannot Continue

**Unsustainability (inevitable consequence):**
_Use language: cannot / will not / fast track to. Not "might struggle"._


**Check:**
- [ ] Uses inevitable language (cannot, will not, fast track to)
- [ ] Feels inevitable, not optional
- [ ] Shows what breaks if they continue

**Examples:**
- "This is a fast track to burnout."
- "Dispensing alone will not sustain this business."
- "You cannot bolt clinical care onto firefighting."
- "Scaling items like this just scales risk."

---

## STEP 7 – Show the Fix, Prove It, Point Forwards

**Fix (the alternative):**
_How the system changes, the shift in the node._


**Proof (named person + concrete outcome):**
_Must include at least one named person and one concrete outcome._


**Forward motion (what this makes possible):**
_End on what this enables next: services, growth, headspace._


**Check:**
- [ ] Fix shows how the system changes
- [ ] Proof includes named person AND concrete outcome
- [ ] Forward motion points to what's next

**Examples:**
- Fix: "AI clears low-risk scripts so pharmacists step off the bench."
- Proof: "Prab now runs 16,000 items a month with no overtime."
- Forward: "The time goes into clinics, not firefighting."

## Caption Skeleton

_Paste your answers below to build the skeleton:_

```
[STEP 3: Hook]

[STEP 4: Failure]

[STEP 5: Cost]

[STEP 6: Unsustainable]

[STEP 7: Fix]

[STEP 7: Proof]

[STEP 7: Forward motion]
```

---

## Final Checklist

Before refining into your final caption, verify:

- [ ] Voice clear? Titan PMR / Titanverse / intersection chosen.
- [ ] One node picked from the model.
- [ ] First line = number, name, or sharp contrast.
- [ ] Failure named in concrete terms.
- [ ] Cost has at least one real number.
- [ ] Consequence feels inevitable, not optional.
- [ ] Fix has named proof and forward motion.

---

## Next Steps

1. Refine the skeleton into your final caption
2. Add transitions between sections
3. Polish language (British English, no em dashes, no hype)
4. Add hashtags if needed
5. Review against Titan rules (no over-claiming, clear separation)

## Quick Reference

**Titan PMR tone:** Calm confidence. Busy, not chaotic. Supported, not firefighting.

**Titanverse tone:** Constructive ambition. Possibility, momentum, opportunity.

**Format performance:**
- Carousel: 60.5% engagement (transformation stories)
- Single image: 5.8% engagement (bold statements)
- Video: High watch time (testimonials, emotional journeys)
