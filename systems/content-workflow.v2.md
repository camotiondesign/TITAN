# Content Workflow v2
**The bridge between the TITAN x TITANVERSE systems model and high-performing posts**

---

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

**Step 1:** Choose voice (Titan PMR / Titanverse / intersection) + format (carousel / single / video).  
**Step 2:** Pick one node (system role / human state / failure mode / operating shift).  
**Step 3:** Write hook with number or name in first line (creates curiosity gap).  
**Step 4:** Name the failure bluntly using concrete nouns (baskets, scripts, hours).  
**Step 5:** Quantify cost in time, money, stress, or opportunity (specific numbers).  
**Step 6:** Show what becomes unsustainable (inevitable consequence, not just difficult).  
**Step 7:** Close loop with specific solution + named proof + forward momentum.

## Introduction

This workflow sits on top of the TITAN x TITANVERSE systems model. It turns that model into consistent, high-performing posts and campaigns.

**What it does:**
- Bridges systems thinking (nodes, loops, failure modes) to actual content formats
- Nudges you toward posts that use known psychological levers
- Respects Titan rules: British English, no hype, no over-claiming, clear separation

**What it is not:**
- A template to copy
- A formula that guarantees performance
- A replacement for editorial judgment

**How to use it:**
- Follow the steps in order when creating a new post
- Answer each question before moving to the next step
- Use the micro-prompts to generate actual sentences
- Reference the example walkthrough when stuck

## The 7 Steps

### STEP 1: Choose Voice & Format

**One-line definition:** Select Titan PMR, Titanverse, or intersection, then choose the format that best serves this story.

**Core question:** Which product world am I in, and what format will best serve this story?

**Micro-prompts:**

**Titan PMR:**
- "This is about dispensing efficiency, safety, or workflow calm"
- "The tone is calm confidence: busy, not chaotic; supported, not firefighting"
- "The system has our back"

**Titanverse:**
- "This is about services, clinics, or patient experience"
- "The tone is constructive ambition: possibility, momentum, opportunity"
- "We can build clinics. We can own the patient relationship."

**Format selection:**
- **Carousel:** Transformation stories, before/after narratives, step-by-step processes (60.5% engagement vs 5.8% single images)
- **Single image:** Bold statements, pattern interruptions, blunt truths
- **Video:** Testimonials, emotional journeys, named operator stories
- **Album:** Multi-location stories, event coverage, team moments

**Psychological lever:** Format choice creates pattern interruption. Carousels reward curiosity with progression. Single images reward boldness with clarity.

**Common mistakes:**
- Choosing format before voice (voice determines format)
- Using single image for transformation stories (carousel performs better)
- Mixing Titan PMR and Titanverse without explicit intersection framing

---

### STEP 2: Select the Node

**One-line definition:** Pick one specific element from the TITAN x TITANVERSE model that you're exposing or shifting.

**Core question:** Which system role, human state, failure mode, or operating shift am I exposing?

**Micro-prompts:**

**System roles:**
- "Pharmacist at bench" (Titan PMR)
- "Pharmacist in consultation room" (Titanverse)
- "Dispenser empowered" (Titan PMR)
- "Owner leading" (Titanverse)
- "Team supported" (Titan PMR)

**Human states:**
- "Stressed" → "Calm" (Titan PMR transformation)
- "Trapped" → "Ambitious" (Titanverse transformation)
- "Firefighting" → "Leading" (Titan PMR)
- "Dependent" → "Independent" (Titanverse)

**Failure modes:**
- "Manual checking" (Titan PMR)
- "Chaos" (Titan PMR)
- "Dependency on dispensing" (Titanverse)
- "No time for services" (Titanverse)
- "Baskets stacking up" (Titan PMR)

**Operating shifts:**
- "From items to services" (Titanverse)
- "From bench to clinic" (Titanverse)
- "From chaos to calm" (Titan PMR)
- "From checking to leading" (Titan PMR)

**Psychological lever:** Node selection creates authority. You're not just describing a feature; you're exposing a system element that others haven't named.

**Common mistakes:**
- Selecting multiple nodes (one post, one node)
- Choosing abstract nodes ("efficiency", "growth") instead of concrete ones ("baskets", "bench time")
- Not connecting node to the operating loop

---

### STEP 3: Write the Hook (Why This Exists)

**One-line definition:** Open with a statement that creates curiosity or contrast, ideally with a specific number or named person.

**Core question:** What's the first line that makes someone stop scrolling?

**Micro-prompts:**

**Titan PMR hooks:**
- "16,000 items a month. No chaos. No overtime."
- "5 years ago, Prabjaudt was ready to leave pharmacy. Now he runs 16,000 items a month."
- "He spends one hour a day in the dispensary. The rest goes into services."

**Titanverse hooks:**
- "He spends one hour a day in the dispensary. The rest goes into services."
- "From 4,000 items to 17,000. He didn't add staff. He added space. For clinics."
- "170,000 items a month sounds impressive. Living it is something else."

**Hook patterns that work:**
- **Statement + contrast:** "16,000 items. No chaos."
- **Number + named person:** "Prabjaudt now safely runs 16,000 items a month."
- **Before/after in one line:** "From 4,000 items to 17,000."
- **Blunt truth:** "Pharmacy is broken. But it's not pharmacists that need fixing."

**Psychological levers:**
- **Curiosity gap:** Number or contrast creates a gap the reader wants to close
- **Pattern interruption:** Statement hook breaks expected pattern
- **Authority:** Named person or specific number creates credibility

**Performance pattern integration:**
- Hard metrics in first 3 lines: "Lead with a number: '16,000 items', '80% of time', '170,000 items a month'. Numbers create credibility."
- Blunt failure naming in line 1: "If naming failure, put it in the hook. 'Pharmacy is broken. But it's not pharmacists that need fixing.'"

**Common mistakes:**
- Starting with template text ("# LinkedIn Caption –")
- Using abstract language ("transform", "innovate", "revolutionise")
- Hiding the number or name until later in the post

---

### STEP 4: Name the Failure Bluntly

**One-line definition:** State the constraint or problem in plain language, using concrete nouns, no abstraction.

**Core question:** What's the specific thing that's broken or unsustainable?

**Micro-prompts:**

**Titan PMR failures:**
- "Pharmacists checking 100% of scripts manually"
- "Baskets stacking up"
- "No time to lead"
- "Ready to leave pharmacy 5 years ago"
- "Too much checking. Too much noise. Too many days shaped by the bench."

**Titanverse failures:**
- "Dispensing alone won't pay the bills"
- "Can't run clinics without freed time"
- "Services squeezed out"
- "80% of day consumed by dispensing"
- "Dependency on dispensing means no growth path"

**Naming rules:**
- Use concrete nouns (baskets, scripts, hours, benches) not abstract concepts (efficiency, growth, optimisation)
- Be specific ("20 pharmacist hours a week") not vague ("too much time")
- Name the thing, not the feeling ("baskets stacking up" not "stress")

**Psychological lever:** Loss aversion. Naming the failure makes the cost of inaction visible.

**Performance pattern integration:**
- Blunt failure naming in line 1: If the failure is the hook, name it there. Otherwise, name it immediately after the hook.

**Common mistakes:**
- Using abstract language ("inefficiency", "challenges", "barriers")
- Softening the failure ("some pharmacies struggle with")
- Naming multiple failures (one post, one failure)

---

### STEP 5: Quantify the Cost

**One-line definition:** Show the real cost in time, money, stress, or opportunity using specific numbers.

**Core question:** What does this failure actually cost in measurable terms?

**Micro-prompts:**

**Titan PMR costs:**
- "20 pharmacist hours a week at the bench"
- "Ready to leave pharmacy 5 years ago"
- "Trying to scale that way was a fast track to burnout"
- "Can't add items without adding stress"
- "Checks fell to around 20 to 30 percent" (showing the before state implicitly)

**Titanverse costs:**
- "80% of day consumed by dispensing"
- "Services squeezed out"
- "Can't build clinics without freed time"
- "Dispensing dependency means no growth path"
- "From 4,000 items. Now 17,000. He didn't add staff. He added space."

**Cost patterns:**
- **Time:** "20 hours a week", "one hour a day", "5 years ago"
- **Money:** Implicit in opportunity cost ("can't run clinics")
- **Stress:** "Ready to leave", "fast track to burnout", "too much noise"
- **Opportunity:** "Services squeezed out", "no growth path", "can't build clinics"

**Psychological lever:** Loss aversion. Specific numbers make the cost tangible and urgent.

**Performance pattern integration:**
- Named operators + specific metrics: "Include at least one named person (Prab, Sagar, Yusuf) and one specific number (16,000 items, 80% time, 20 hours saved)"
- Hard metrics in first 3 lines: If not in hook, quantify cost immediately after naming failure

**Common mistakes:**
- Using vague costs ("too much time", "a lot of stress")
- Not connecting cost to the node selected in Step 2
- Quantifying multiple costs (one post, one primary cost)

---

### STEP 6: Show What Becomes Unsustainable

**One-line definition:** Make the consequence inevitable, not just difficult. Show what breaks if this continues.

**Core question:** What breaks if this continues?

**Micro-prompts:**

**Titan PMR unsustainability:**
- "Trying to scale that way was a fast track to burnout"
- "Can't add items without adding stress"
- "Five years ago, I would not be able to be having this conversation with you. I'd probably still be in my dispensary trying to check hundreds of baskets, being incredibly stressed and just not really enjoying pharmacy."
- "The workflow cannot support IP"

**Titanverse unsustainability:**
- "Dispensing dependency means no growth path"
- "Can't build clinics without freed time"
- "Dispensing alone will not pay the bills in the long term"
- "You cannot bolt clinical care onto a workflow held together by firefighting"

**Unsustainability patterns:**
- **Inevitability:** "was a fast track to", "cannot", "will not"
- **Business model pressure:** "no growth path", "won't pay the bills"
- **Personal cost:** "burnout", "ready to leave", "incredibly stressed"

**Psychological lever:** Loss aversion + inevitability. Not just "this is hard" but "this will break".

**Performance pattern integration:**
- Emotional transformation arc: "Map emotional state: Before (stressed/trapped) → After (calm/ambitious). Use quotes to show shift."

**Common mistakes:**
- Softening the consequence ("may struggle", "could face challenges")
- Not connecting to the operating loop (unsustainability should relate to the node)
- Making it about individual failure rather than system failure

---

### STEP 7: Close the Loop (Point to the Fix)

**One-line definition:** Show how the node shifts or the system resolves. Include specific solution, named proof, and forward momentum.

**Core question:** What's the credible alternative that makes this sustainable?

**Micro-prompts:**

**Titan PMR fixes:**
- "AI clears 70% of scripts, pharmacist steps off bench"
- "System has our back"
- "No chaos. No compromise."
- "Prabjaudt now safely runs 16,000 items a month"
- "Checks fell to around 20 to 30 percent. Services grew by hundreds of percent."

**Titanverse fixes:**
- "Freed time converts to services"
- "From items to clinics"
- "He spends one hour a day in the dispensary. The rest goes into services: travel clinics, contraception, ear care, weight loss."
- "Pharmacists moved into consultation rooms"

**Fix patterns:**
- **Specific solution:** "AI clears 70%", "barcode scanning checks every item", "automated texts"
- **Proof (named operator/metric):** "Prabjaudt now safely runs 16,000 items", "Sagar 4x items", "Yusuf runs 12 pharmacies"
- **Forward momentum:** "The rest goes into services", "He even built a second consultation room", "Services grew by hundreds of percent"

**Psychological levers:**
- **Authority:** Named proof creates credibility
- **Social currency:** Specific metrics create shareability
- **Hope:** Forward momentum shows possibility

**Performance pattern integration:**
- Named operators + specific metrics: "Include at least one named person (Prab, Sagar, Yusuf) and one specific number (16,000 items, 80% time, 20 hours saved)"
- Emotional transformation arc: Show the after state clearly. Use quotes to demonstrate the shift.

**Common mistakes:**
- Vague solutions ("better systems", "improved workflow")
- No proof (missing named operator or specific metric)
- No forward momentum (ending on the fix without showing what's next)

## Format Selection Guidance

### When to Use Carousel

**Best for:**
- Transformation stories (before/after)
- Step-by-step processes
- Multiple proof points
- Visual metaphors that reinforce message

**Structure (Dopamine Curve):**
1. Hook (cover slide)
2. Pain (failure named)
3. Insight (cost quantified)
4. Shift (unsustainability shown)
5. Proof (fix with named operator)
6. CTA (forward momentum)

**Performance:** 60.5% engagement vs 5.8% single images

**Example:** Priory Pharmacy carousel showing transformation from chaos to calm with specific metrics.

### When to Use Single Image

**Best for:**
- Bold statements
- Pattern interruptions
- Blunt truths
- Regulatory/industry positions

**Structure:**
- Hook in first line (often the failure named bluntly)
- Cost quantified immediately
- Fix pointed to (often implicit)
- Forward momentum in CTA

**Performance:** Lower engagement but higher authority for thought leadership

**Example:** "Pharmacy is broken. But it's not pharmacists that need fixing."

### When to Use Video

**Best for:**
- Testimonials
- Emotional journeys
- Named operator stories
- Step-by-step demonstrations

**Structure:**
- Hook (emotional state or transformation)
- Character (named operator)
- Challenge (failure named)
- Solution (fix shown)
- Results (proof with metrics)
- CTA (forward momentum)

**Performance:** High watch time for emotional stories

**Example:** BMP Healthcare video with Yusuf talking through the shift from pressure to calm.

---

## Performance Pattern Integration

### Pattern 1: Named Operators + Specific Metrics

**Which steps create this:** Steps 2 (node selection), 5 (quantify cost), 7 (close loop)

**Micro-prompt addition:** "Include at least one named person (Prab, Sagar, Yusuf) and one specific number (16,000 items, 80% time, 20 hours saved)"

**Why it works:** Creates credibility and shareability. Numbers create authority. Names create relatability.

### Pattern 2: Blunt Failure Naming in Line 1

**Which steps create this:** Step 3 (hook) + Step 4 (name failure)

**Micro-prompt addition:** "If naming failure, put it in the hook. 'Pharmacy is broken. But it's not pharmacists that need fixing.'"

**Why it works:** Pattern interruption. Creates curiosity gap. Shows authority.

### Pattern 3: Before/After Contrast in Carousel Cover

**Which steps create this:** Step 1 (format selection) + Step 3 (hook)

**Micro-prompt addition:** "For carousels, cover slide should show before/after: 'From 4,000 items to 17,000' or 'From bench to clinic'"

**Why it works:** Visual contrast creates immediate curiosity. Rewards scrolling with progression.

### Pattern 4: Emotional Transformation Arc

**Which steps create this:** Steps 4-6 (failure → cost → unsustainability) + Step 7 (resolution)

**Micro-prompt addition:** "Map emotional state: Before (stressed/trapped) → After (calm/ambitious). Use quotes to show shift."

**Why it works:** Emotional resonance. Creates relatability. Shows possibility.

### Pattern 5: Hard Metrics in First 3 Lines

**Which steps create this:** Step 3 (hook) + Step 5 (quantify cost)

**Micro-prompt addition:** "Lead with a number: '16,000 items', '80% of time', '170,000 items a month'. Numbers create credibility."

**Why it works:** Authority. Credibility. Shareability. Numbers are concrete and memorable.

## Example Walkthrough: Priory Pharmacy Case Study

**Step 1: Choose Voice & Format**
- Voice: Titan PMR (dispensing efficiency, workflow calm)
- Format: Carousel (transformation story, before/after narrative)

**Step 2: Select the Node**
- Node: "Pharmacist at bench" → "Pharmacist leading"
- Human state: "Stressed" → "Calm"
- Failure mode: "Manual checking, chaos, no time to lead"

**Step 3: Write the Hook**
- Hook: "5 years ago, Prabjaudt was ready to leave pharmacy. Now he runs 16,000 items a month."
- Pattern: Before/after + named person + specific number

**Step 4: Name the Failure Bluntly**
- Failure: "Everything was manual, systems didn't talk to each other"
- Concrete: "Trying to check hundreds of baskets, being incredibly stressed"

**Step 5: Quantify the Cost**
- Cost: "Five years ago, I would not be able to be having this conversation with you. I'd probably still be in my dispensary trying to check hundreds of baskets, being incredibly stressed and just not really enjoying pharmacy."
- Time: Implicit (all day in dispensary)
- Stress: "incredibly stressed", "ready to leave"

**Step 6: Show What Becomes Unsustainable**
- Unsustainability: "Trying to scale that way wasn't just hard. It was a fast track to burnout."
- Inevitability: "was a fast track to" (not "could lead to")

**Step 7: Close the Loop**
- Fix: "AI clears 70% of scripts", "barcode scanning", "automated texts"
- Proof: "Prabjaudt now safely runs 16,000 items a month. No chaos. No compromise."
- Forward momentum: "His pharmacy flows. His team stays calm."

**Result:** High-performing carousel (111% engagement rate) that follows all performance patterns.

## Titan Rules (Always Apply)

**Language:**
- British English only
- No em dashes or en dashes
- Short sentences. No waffle.
- Plain language, not poetic

**Tone:**
- Titan PMR: Calm confidence. Busy, not chaotic.
- Titanverse: Constructive ambition. Possibility, momentum, opportunity.

**Claims:**
- No over-claiming clinical outcomes
- No hype language ("game changing", "revolutionising")
- Specific numbers, not vague promises

**Separation:**
- Clear separation of Titan PMR vs Titanverse
- Never merge into one product
- Intersection posts must follow correct sequence: dispensing problem → Titan PMR stabilises → Titanverse converts stability into service value

---

## Implementation Notes

### Tagging System

Add `workflow_step_used` field to `campaign-meta.json`:

```json
{
  "workflow_step_used": {
    "step_1_voice": "Titan PMR",
    "step_1_format": "carousel",
    "step_2_node": "Pharmacist at bench → Pharmacist leading",
    "step_3_hook_type": "before_after_named_person",
    "step_4_failure_named": "Manual checking, chaos",
    "step_5_cost_type": "time_stress",
    "step_6_unsustainability_type": "burnout_inevitable",
    "step_7_proof_type": "named_operator_metric"
  }
}
```

### Analysis Enhancement

Track which workflow steps correlate with highest TCPS:
- Which hook types perform best?
- Which node selections drive engagement?
- Which failure naming patterns create urgency?
- Which proof types build credibility?

### Template Updates

Add workflow step checklist to campaign templates:

```markdown
## Content Workflow Checklist

- [ ] Step 1: Voice and format selected
- [ ] Step 2: Node identified (system role / human state / failure mode / operating shift)
- [ ] Step 3: Hook written with number or name in first line
- [ ] Step 4: Failure named bluntly with concrete nouns
- [ ] Step 5: Cost quantified with specific numbers
- [ ] Step 6: Unsustainability shown (inevitable, not just difficult)
- [ ] Step 7: Loop closed with specific solution + named proof + forward momentum
```

## Final Notes

This workflow is a bridge, not a formula. Use it to:
- Structure your thinking
- Generate actual sentences
- Connect systems model to content formats
- Apply psychological levers deliberately

Do not use it to:
- Copy templates verbatim
- Skip editorial judgment
- Ignore context or audience

The goal is consistent, high-performing content that makes the truth about modern pharmacy impossible to ignore and easy to act on.
