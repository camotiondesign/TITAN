# How TITAN Helped Pharmacies Dispense 10 Million Items Without the Chaos

You read that right. Ten. Million. Items. In a single month.

In April 2025, pharmacies powered by TITAN PMR processed over 10 million prescriptions across the UK.

That number alone is striking, but the real story lies in what it represents. Independent pharmacies are under immense pressure: more volume, tighter margins, rising expectations. The answer isn’t simply working harder. It’s working smarter.

This milestone reflects a turning point: a move away from outdated systems and manual processes towards a model built around smart efficiency, automation and team empowerment. With TITAN, pharmacies are shifting from reactive firefighting to proactive, scalable workflows — and reclaiming their time in the process.

## 🚧 Common Pharmacy Workflow Challenges

Let’s face it — traditional PMRs weren’t designed for today’s demands. Manual checks, paper tokens, handwritten notes, endless rekeying. It’s inefficient. It’s error-prone. And it ties your most skilled professionals to repetitive admin.

Many pharmacies feel stuck: overwhelmed by prescription backlogs, struggling to scale, and unable to free up the pharmacist to focus on patient-facing care.

TITAN changes that.

## ✅ From Workflow to Results: The TITAN Way

Here’s how TITAN turns operational headaches into streamlined, digital-first success.

### 🧠 AI-Driven Prescription Management

TITAN AI automatically downloads, clinically screens, and processes prescriptions in the background. This creates a true “walkaway” model — freeing pharmacists to focus on consultations, service delivery and business leadership, without compromising clinical oversight.

### 🧾 Barcode Safety, Built In

With TITAN Repeat Flow, barcode verification is embedded into the dispensing process. Labels only print once the correct drug, strength, and brand are scanned. This eliminates the need for manual double-checks and significantly reduces dispensing errors — giving your team greater confidence with every script.

### 📦 Batch Dispensing for High Volumes

Dealing with high volumes of repeat prescriptions or care home meds? TITAN Batch allows you to process hundreds of items in a single, efficient flow — ideal for hub-and-spoke operations or repeat-heavy branches.

### 📊 Intelligent Inventory at a Glance

Forget stock card guesswork. With inventory tools built into TITAN Stock, your team can monitor stock levels and expiry dates in real time — surfacing what’s running low and supporting proactive reordering.

### 🧾 Fully Paperless from End to End

TITAN eliminates the mess of tokens, sticky notes, and handwritten messages. From EPS download to patient collection, the process is digital, trackable, and built for clarity — improving team communication and audit trail visibility.

### 📱 Empowering Front-of-House Teams

TITAN Mobile gives counter staff real-time tools to scan shelves, locate prescriptions instantly, and manage collections with confidence — all without having to interrupt the pharmacist.
