With the Original Pack Dispensing (OPD) legislation coming into effect from 1st January 2025, TITAN is proud to announce full support for this game-changing update, ensuring pharmacies stay compliant while optimising their operations.

## What is Original Pack Dispensing?

From January 2025, the new OPD legislation mandates that pharmacists must dispense medication in its original manufacturer's pack when clinically appropriate. This change aims to:

- Reduce medicine waste
