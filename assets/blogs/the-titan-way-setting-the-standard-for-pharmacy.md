# The Titan Way: Setting the Standard for Pharmacy

For too long, community pharmacies have been running on systems designed decades ago that might have worked back then, but are now struggling to keep up with the pace and pressure of modern pharmacy.

Too many pharmacists still start their day with a mountain of baskets. They spend most of their time trapped in the dispensary, doing manual checks, clearing backlogs, and chasing scripts, feeling further away from patients than ever.

It’s no surprise that pharmacy teams across the country are burned out, overwhelmed, and looking for something better.

That’s exactly why we created Titan.

It is not just a better PMR but a smarter, more innovative way of working. It gives pharmacists their time, clarity, and clinical focus back. One that turns "the way it’s always been" into "the way it should be."

## No More ‘Day One’ Chaos

Starting a new system in a busy pharmacy can feel like jumping into the deep end. Most pharmacists expect day one to be a write-off — chaos, confusion, and backlog.

But with Titan, it’s a different story.

> "I thought the first day was going to be chaos. But by 11 o’clock, we’d already done four or five services. Usually, there’s a hundred baskets for me to deal with… We were caught up by lunchtime."  
> — Ian, Avicenna Pharmacy

Titan’s digital-first workflow isn’t just intuitive — it’s immediate. Teams don’t waste time figuring things out. They get straight to work. Prescriptions arrive digitally — and stay digital. No printing. No paper trails. Just progress.

## Everyone’s in Sync

When systems are clunky, slow, or unclear, pharmacy teams fall out of rhythm. Titan changes that.

Its smart prescription board keeps the whole team aligned. Everyone sees the workflow. Everyone knows what’s next. There’s no confusion, no delays, and no time wasted.

> "Everybody knew exactly what they were doing." — Ian, Avicenna Pharmacy  
> "Titan removes the noise." — Tajinder Dhami, Davina Pharmacy

## Automation That Works

Titan AI reviews every prescription with a 40-point clinical check. It flags high-risk items. It corrects dosages. It even strips out unhelpful instructions and standardises for safety.

Dispensers scan and pick. Barcode validation ensures the correct patient, drug, strength, and expiry — all before a label is printed.

> "It feels like we’re operating five years in the future."  
> — Jay Patel, Wellbeing Pharmacy

This isn’t “automation” in name only. This is real, intelligent support.

## Pharmacists Where They Belong

When manual processes dominate the day, pharmacists are pulled away from patients.

Titan flips the balance. AI and automation handle the admin. Pharmacists get back to clinical care, services, and meaningful impact.

> "I got to spend my time being a pharmacist again." — Ian, Avicenna Pharmacy  
> "Titan has brought the joy back into pharmacy." — Ishpal Basra, Balhousie Pharmacy  
> "We’ve got more time for patients, more time for services, and more time for ourselves." — Dave Edwards, RX Advisor

## No Paper. No Panic. No Waste.

Titan eliminates the chaos:

- Prescriptions stay digital  
- Backlogs shrink  
- Label printing is smart and accurate  
- Collections are tracked effortlessly  

Patients receive an SMS when their prescriptions are ready, along with a unique code that directs staff directly to the item. No more shelf-scanning. No more guessing.

> "Since switching to Titan, we’ve got our evenings and weekends back." — Rupen Patel, Vivek Pharmacy  
> "Titan has given us our time back." — Ishpal Basra, Balhousie Pharmacy

## Time, Space, and Clarity to Grow

With day-to-day workflows transformed, Titan provides pharmacy owners and operators with the space to think bigger.

Whether scaling services, opening clinics, or managing multiple branches, Titan scales with your ambition.

> "There’s no way I’d ever go back." — Jay, Ishpal, Tajinder, Rupen

## The Proof Is in the Practice

Titan isn’t a concept. It’s a working reality in hundreds of pharmacies across the UK:

- 80% of scripts are now automated with Titan AI  
- 500+ near misses avoided  
- 0 paper. 0 manual logbooks. 0 chaos.  

> "The time saving is beyond belief." — Sukhjit, Reading  
> "Titan has completely changed the way I look at pharmacy." — Jay Patel  
> "I didn’t believe it until I saw it." — A common reaction from pharmacy visitors
