# What Do Community Pharmacies Actually Do in 2025?

Community pharmacies have long been associated with dispensing medications and selling over-the-counter products. However, their role has evolved significantly in recent years. Despite this evolution, common perceptions persist — phrases like “you’re just shopkeepers” or “you can’t treat me, I need a doctor” reflect a limited understanding of the modern pharmacist’s role.

Recent surveys indicate that while **89% of people in England are comfortable with pharmacists treating minor illnesses**, only **29% visit a community pharmacy monthly**. This shows a clear gap between public comfort with expanded services and actual utilisation.

This blog explores the persistent myths about community pharmacies and highlights their contributions in 2025.

## 1. “Pharmacists just count pills.”

Not even close. Pharmacists are highly trained clinicians who:

- Conduct clinical screening
- Review interactions, allergies, and dosing
- Deliver vaccination and health checks
- Work as independent prescribers managing conditions and minor illness

Today, the dispensary is a clinical space — not a production line.

**TITAN transforms this role.**  
With TITAN AI, prescriptions are automatically downloaded, clinically screened against 40 safety checks, and prepared for dispensing through a walkaway workflow, freeing pharmacists for clinical care.

---

## 2. “Prescriptions should only take 2 minutes to fill.”

In reality, each prescription involves:

- Clinical checks
- Product selection
- Labelling
- Accuracy and safety verification
- Possible prescriber communication

Thanks to TITAN’s workflow automation, simple repeats progress with minimal human input, barcoding ensures correct selection, and automation clears the administrative backlog — safely.

## 3. “Community pharmacies just sell shampoo and paracetamol.”

Retail is surface-level. Today’s pharmacies provide:

- NHS and private vaccinations
- Hypertension case finding
- Emergency contraception
- Smoking cessation support
- Minor illness assessments (Pharmacy First)

With digital tools like **TITAN Mobile**, clinical care isn’t confined to the consultation room — it’s wherever the patient is.

Pharmacies are becoming frontline access points for the NHS.

---

## 4. “Independent pharmacies can’t match the big chains.”

They don’t just match them — many outperform them.

Powered by cloud-based PMRs like TITAN, independents benefit from:

- Automated workflow
- Full paperless operation
- TITAN Batch for volume dispensing
- TITAN Mail for digital prescription intake
- Walkaway clinical checking

Agile updates and personal support give independents the competitive edge legacy chains can’t match.

---

## 5. “Out-of-stock medicines mean pharmacies are disorganised.”

Most shortages stem from:

- Manufacturing issues
- Supply delays
- National pricing changes

Pharmacies absorb the frustration so the patient doesn’t have to.

**TITAN Mail** helps digitise communications, and upcoming stock tools will streamline shortage management further.

Your pharmacy isn’t the problem — they’re the solution.

---

## 6. “Generics don’t work as well as branded meds.”

Generics:

- Contain the same active ingredients
- Meet MHRA regulation standards
- Differ only in packaging, name, and cost

Pharmacists dispense generics to protect NHS resources — without compromising care.

---

## 7. “AI and robots will replace pharmacists.”

No — AI supports. It doesn’t supplant.

TITAN AI:

- Flags anomalies
- Identifies risks
- Standardises instructions

But only pharmacists:

- Make clinical decisions
- Provide care
- Build trust

AI powers workflow; pharmacists power outcomes.
