Speaker 1  0:00  
So my name's Priti, and I'm the superintendent of harlots pharmacy, and been here for about just over 10 years now. So harlots pharmacy dispenses around six to six and a half 1000 items per month. Most of them are electronic, but yeah, that's where we're sitting at the moment. So they come via their electronic prescriptions, as opposed to physical prescriptions that a patient has to bring in. So once the doctors have have approved it, they click Send, and it comes across the NHS spine straight down to us. So yeah, so we we've got it spooling. So every two minutes, the system is checking for us if there's any more prescriptions to come down and and it should just download automatically. Sometimes, if a patient hasn't nominated a pharmacy, then if they come in, we can have a look on the on their record, search a spine, and call it down for them. So So afternoons can be busier, because we tend to see a huge download around about two o'clock. So if somebody were to pop in in the afternoon to see us. We would typically be dispensing prescriptions. There'd probably be one dispenser dispensing prescriptions, a second dispenser getting on and dispensing for our trade, patients, our counter assessment would be busy on the counter, either looking for people's prescriptions, or just serving on the counter. Pharmacists could be anywhere from clinically checking or usually sitting in the consultation room carrying out one of our various appointments. Most of the time we're all over the place. We could be in the room, or we could be chatting to the patients. Sometimes we deliberately want to just go and help the team so they can be free to carry out other services. But when we're not required, in as much as we keep up to date with our clinical checks, and if there's any accuracy checks, which is a very small number of actual total number of prescriptions, we do so the biggest key, I think, is to stay calm. The whole team works in a calm manner. We work with each other, communicate with each other, and obviously the technology we have in place helps us to to oversee what's going on much more easily as well. But I think the two biggest key factors that help is staying calm and communicating with each other. Yeah, I think part of it is the way I work. Even if I'm feeling a little bit distressed internally, I try not to show the team, because then everybody's just was just stressed out. However, I think when patients can see that you're hunting through a huge mound of baskets or hunting through the shelves for their prescription, then it can come across as being more chaotic, and we don't look chaotic anymore, because the systems allow us to see where we're at at each point, so we can confidently go and tell the patient that your prescription just come down, or it's on the shelf, or it's actually being dispensed already, which we couldn't before, because you'd be having to hunt through a load of things to see where we were at. So we've got four benches in the dispensary, four distinct areas of working and one bench in the middle was purely for baskets that had been dispensed by the dispensers, where they would then place these baskets for the pharmacist to check the items. And typically, that bench would be full of baskets waiting to be checked. Even as quickly as you might be checking them, there's more and more baskets being added the functions that I love most about Titan that we could not live without now are the ability to scan and use that scanning function to accuracy check most of our prescriptions, and the only ones that come, and that's by choice to the pharmacies for checking are split packs and control drugs without that, I wouldn't be able to guarantee what's going out if I'm stuck in a consultation is accurate, and then you'd want to to accuracy check it again at the end, so that that saves the pharmacist a lot of time. And the second is the AI function. So I have Titan X on as soon as I walk in, and it will typically check between 50 to 60% of my prescriptions, sometimes more, without them, waiting for me to clinically check them. So it just makes sure that the dispensary is continuously ticking over and I can be stuck in the room for two three hours without stressing about what's going on out there. Absolutely it makes such a huge difference. And the key is knowing that it's doing it safely for you as well. And I like, I like to test things out, so we always sort of see what's going on. And you've got to have that confidence in your system as well. People pick it up very, very easily. I think the key is their mindset. So we've had the odd person who refuses to move away from the old working habits and wonders why we haven't got piles and piles of labels ready for them, or piles and piles of printed tokens. However, 90, I would say, 90% plus of anybody new coming in here, whether it's a locum or a new member of staff, have loved it. Have picked it up very easily, because it is intuitive. Once you know how Titan thinks, it's very easy to work out how to navigate around the system. You look at it initially and you think, oh my gosh, there's just so much on there. But actually, when you break it up, there is not much on there, and each section is relevant to different members of the team, so I literally only have to focus on two maybe three lines. So I've got the bits where I need to clinic of check, and then the bits where there might be something waiting for me to accuracy check, the rest of it the team can work on. I love the fact that I can come out of this consultation room after a long consultation, and not have a huge mound of baskets on that middle bench, because inevitably, it had to be done, and it was quite stressful, because ultimately, we are human, and we're conscious that we need to get that done in a timely manner, and you don't rush it. You do it thoroughly, but you're always worried that, what if I've missed something? And I actually these days, the whole team goes home less stressed, because we know that things have gone out accurately, because the system has helped us to make sure it stays accurate. I think the worst thing we had to do with proscript is where we would be printing off the tokens for all prescriptions we dispensed, and then using those tokens once we handed out to scan, to claim, which could take up a whole day, two days at the end of the month before I could send off my submission with with Titan, I just literally press, send on a daily basis by midday on the first of every month, I can have my end of the month completed and is out of the way. I've never had an issue with with claims not going through. I think when, when, when I've heard of people having issues, is where they're leaving loads and loads to the end, because that's when everybody's going to be claiming. Whereas my claims will be, I'll be sending them off two or three times a day. You just submit your your claims every day, and your number is not going to be high. But if you're trying to send 456, 1000 items one day, then there is going to be a delay in that being updated. I mean, because, I mean, the NHS doesn't look at it until you've sent your submission. However, it's gone. The claim is gone. We could do but because it was a more mundane process, sometimes I would find other people would leave it for me, and as the business owner, I had no choice if I wanted to get paid to do it. So yeah. So what it is is, because the prescriptions are electronic, obviously the manual ones, you have to still count and then send that off at the end of the month. But the electronic ones, everything is electronic, so the NHS, PSA sees what you've given electronically and pays you from from that, there's no reason why you just can't send it as soon as you've even dispensed it. So a lot of people don't understand how pharmacy claims work. So, I mean, I have, in the past, had people question me as to why I'm questioning their prescription with their GP, or questioning the safety of something and and I did have one person who, who, who, when I asked her about putting her onto an NMS say, Well, why the hell do you think you have the right to ask me? You don't. You're just a shopkeeper. And no, normally I've walked away from such situations, and I actually decided on this scale turn around, and I said, just out of interest, do you know what the qualifications of a pharmacist are? And she was actually, genuinely shocked to realize we'd go through quite a rigorous university degree to do this job. We're there to safeguard you, and I leave the shop sales to my staff, because I don't need to be involved in that. It's just something farms businesses do. My focus is, is, is on the medicine, because that's what I studied and that's what I had a passion for. So they do, yeah, exactly that, that guy complaining about that sun cream. Well, 5% of my business is shop sales. 95% is in here. It's not in my interest to hike up the price, because I'm not getting anything. Anyways, if I look at it from a pharmacist point of view, I would probably be saving on a weekly basis, I think definitely, about 10 hours a week on time spent just checking, possibly more, because I'm not doing that many accuracy checks anymore. And if I look at it from the perspective of a business owner, it saves me an immense, immense amount of time, because things that I have to do from a business perspective, like the claims,

Speaker 1  9:56  
things that I can do from home, that I can oversee. The staff, it's just made it so much easier. So whereas, I think before Titan, running three businesses, was very, very difficult, because you didn't have the oversight, unless you went to the pharmacy and went through a load of things with the staff, I can see remotely, which my staff didn't like so much, but I can see remotely what's going on and where they might need support or where they're maybe not, you know, following processes, because I can just see by, by logging into Titan and seeing what where we're at. So, so you need that oversight to be able to a make sure the processes you have put in place are being followed, but, but ultimately, we, you know, we are a profession, but we are also business. You're there, to get a job done and to make money from doing that job. So definitely, I would probably be spending the vast majority of my time checking off prescriptions. So we'd usually have a dispenser labeling another one, collecting the baskets, and then a huge mountain of baskets for me to check, because I don't have that anymore all that time. And probably, I know I said, it probably saves me about 10 hours a week, but I think if I look look at a day, then I'm saving four hours a day, at least not checking those baskets. Then if I look at how it saves us time, the whole team in hunting where that prescription is, and when I say hunting, I mean just picking up the ego and having a look, as opposed to physically hunting, which was what we had to do before, that saves so much time, and it looks more professional in front of the patient, because it doesn't look like we don't know what we're doing. We just can find where it is more easily. So, yeah, I think, I think on a daily basis, as a team, we're probably saving for four or five hours at least, checking and hunting down things, which makes it more efficient process overall. So we've got from Monday to Friday, we've got two full time dispensers who are also ACDS. We run a post office here as well, so we've got a full time member of staff who mainly manages the post office, but he's also done the counter assistance training, so hops in and helps us out on this side when he can. And then we've got a trainee dispenser who does 30 hours a week, I think definitely one extra full timer, purely because it's the way we worked, if I look back, was quite time consuming, even though we always worked quite efficiently, the processes took up human resources more, and one of the reasons I looked to move to Titan is at that time, I wasn't looking to cut back on staff, but I was looking at ways of working more efficiently, to free the staff up to be able to do other jobs, like helping with BP checks and things. So if we were to continue at that level, I think definitely one extra full timer would be needed and and if you look at it from the perspective of of a member of staff, there's nothing more mundane than just going through mountains and mountains of prescriptions all day long. They were not free to do anything else, because, well, I mean, as a pharmacist, as an owner, I'm not going to say like you, you do this. I'm going to do that for you, because I've got other things I need to get on with. Now we have a less stressful environment. We get all the jobs done, plus more, but the staff are now free to help with with other services. So they do earwax removal for me. They do all the BP checks. They help with the abpms, and I just monitor the results these jobs that I couldn't have thought of giving them to do before, because I would have lost them, because it would have just been too much on their plate as well, and they were just then left to do what is an essential but the more more boring part of The job, which is dispensing so it's a better working environment for them, as well as us. Using Titan has freed me up Firstly, to then focus my efforts on the staff, so that I have now got the time to train them up to to use the skills that they do have and allow them to develop and and they come back to me and say, Can I do this? And can we do that? Now I actually have the capacity to say, well, yes, we can look at that and look at the training, and let you do that as well. So before it'd be like, yeah, when are we going to fit that in? So it's it's definitely better for them, as as individuals, to become upskilled, but as a business owner, it's allowing us to fit in a lot more in a day, bringing in more revenue. That's allowing me to then have the capacity to develop other services via the team, which we wouldn't have been able to afford before. So I mean, even if I look at something as simple as a blood pressure check. Egg, we were maybe hitting 1015

Unknown Speaker  15:03  
a month, if we were lucky, before Titan,

Speaker 1  15:08  
apart from the last month, we've been hitting about 60 to 70 BP checks a month, because they're free freer to fit that in alongside all the other jobs they're required to do. And we also work with Hillingdon, and they provide the AF checks as well. So this is all extra income to the business that we wouldn't have been able to see. The other thing they're really, really good at is, and this is what I touched on earlier, is it's nobody here acts like everything runs because of them. It's very much a team effort, whether it's pushing NHS services, whether it's pushing private services, the whole team works together. So if we've got flu and covid clinics going on, everybody's involved, everybody's pushing it, everybody's getting that message to the patient, we're booking them in. We're helping book people in. But they also do that with my private services. So it's, it's a case of, they're freeing themselves up to let people know what we do, what private services we can offer them and and how it works. So it's, it's, if I look at, especially in the last couple of years, we've we've gone from maybe, you know, I'm lucky if I see one private consultation a month to seeing two or three a day. And that also means where I'm free. I'm being able to give that patient my time in a less stressful manner, so that your reputation goes up, and they will then go out and tell other people to come and use our facilities, because we're able to give them that time. But I can only do that knowing that my dispensary is running efficiently and safely as well. Dispensing is essential. But if you look at how pharmacies ran 2030, years ago, is all about dispensing and counseling. We've always done that as pharmacies. I mean, I've been a pharmacist for over 30 years now, and I've always counseled people. You've always spoken to them about over the counter, remedies, prescriptions. So that's not changed. What? What has changed, though, is, is the financial structure. It was quite profitable to be just doing that 2030, years ago. You cannot survive with just that business anymore. So you, you do have to get involved. So initially we started looking at privately, what, what private services could we offer? And we started off with travel as our first private offering. And it takes a while to build up, but you have to, you have to keep at it. Obviously, over the last few years, the NHS has opened up more services that we can do on the NHS. Obviously pharmacy first being one of those key services so and I think it's the right way to go, because we have so much knowledge and so much skill as pharmacists to be able to offer our patients, but it's nice to be able to be paid for that as well. You have to listen to your patients, because there's no point in putting something into place that they really don't care about, because you won't make your money back on your investment. So we've always listened to what they're asking for. So you know, they might come in and say, do you do travel, or do you do flu, or do you do private covid vaccines, things like that. And then we would look at what it involves for us, costs training, and give it a go. We've, there are, there are a lot of things that we've built up in that way, and some of it is being where it's being personal interest. So for instance, when pharma Doctor introduced the weight management module, I learned about it, and I did some extra training, and I did it, not really knowing what the uptake was. And it's quite an apprehensive one to start with as well, because it's very, very different to some of the other services we're used to. But then you introduce it, and you start seeing clients, and your confidence grows, and then you realize that you've actually helped someone, and they've gone around telling other people, go here. So now we've gone from in a year and a half, two years, we've gone from one client to we've got about 18 active clients at the moment using our weight management service, and 90% of that business has been word of mouth, or recently, a couple of surgeries have told People that they've heard we do the service, and they've heard good things about it, so maybe check us out. We haven't analyzed it yet, although I've, my husband does all the accounts and everything for me and but I want to do a breakdown now, since we've gone from three to one pharmacy, I want to see how, how much, where, where I'm just active with one. Know how much it's pushed up, because obviously I had to divide my time before we were only able to provide the service Monday to Wednesday. Now we can do Monday to Saturday, but definitely it's becoming a bigger and bigger part of our income our private services. Because if you look at even just simply the weight management, you're looking at a reasonable return on one patient on one month. And if you've got 18 clients on it, it's a good revenue for that month. So it's a volume so we've kept our pricing through mid range, because I've got to value my work as well. And it does take, it takes time. I will give that patient their first appointment you're looking at up to an hour, but what I will give them is that full attention, and I want to make sure whatever I provide is safe, and I make that quite clear to the clients as well. About you, it's not guaranteed you're getting anything today unless I feel it's safe and you're happy with what I'm telling you. But it's also not just about giving them something, but it's giving them food for thought, in a way, about how to keep that weight off going down the line. Because any weight management program you go on to, you lose some weight, but you will put it back on again if you don't change your strategies going forward as well. So it's just helping them with that. It's interesting. There was one course I did that was so interesting, and it's making it you think about the chemistry of eating and how the brain associates food with other things, but people sometimes forget that your hunger can be or lack of hunger can be overridden by just fancying something, or if you're feeling a bit low, or you've gone out, and you think, right, I'm just gonna do what I can because I'm out and I'm on holiday so and it's just working on on that science as well to say, well, actually, this is when we start seeing problems, because that chemistry where our brain overrides everything else and says, yeah, It doesn't matter. Just have that extra piece of cake. It's going to be fine. Is actually what's causing the issue, not the fact that most of the time you're eating healthily and you know what's right, and you're being careful. But our brain will override that sometimes and say, Well, yeah, it doesn't matter. Just have it. We've all been there, but I sit there talking to patients every day about it, but I think, well, yeah, I do that as well, but it does now. It's, it's got a way of capturing if somebody is has got a new medicine, but if the staff Miss asking patients at the time of handout, I can see the list of patients who were highlighted as having an NMS, and I can contact them retrospectively and say, you, is this a new medicine? And would you be okay for us calling you to make sure you're getting on okay after a week or so and and it's helped us to capture more patients that way. I think when, when we first went on to Titan, they didn't have that so we were missing so many NMSS because we couldn't flag them, and if the staff didn't bother asking a handout, that was it. We didn't know who we've missed. So in that respect, it's really, really good. Now, yeah, 100% we've gone from like five or six a month to hitting 6065 a month. So paperless is, is is brilliant. Because, I mean, I've never, I've never chosen to do things like NMS on a paper version, because I find when you've got paper, it can be filed all over the place. You might be struggling to read somebody's handwriting if another pharmacist has carried out part of the service. So I've always looked for a model where I can do it electronically, save it electronically. But generally, going paperless with everything we do is brilliant, because it means things can get updated. Things are more legible, and there's a better oversight of where we are at each stage. So paperless is wonderful, both for the environment and for the way we work. We, before we had Titan, we would have struggled. We were struggling to carry out more BP checks, to do our LMSs, because we were just so bogged down with, we're just trying to run the dispensary. It was, it's a very labor intensive role, especially for the pharmacist, if you've then got a huge mound of baskets to check through, the last thing you're going to think of is, shall I call that patient for the NMS, or should I fit in that VP check? Because you know that patients are going to come back for their prescriptions and they don't care about the other things they want that basket that you need to check off. So going to Titan and not having that stress of

Speaker 1  24:46  
having to accuracy check everything, having to hunt around for things, saving that time making it more streamlined and efficient has freed us up to to provide these other services that we were struggling to to put. Divide where we're on the stock control trials. So we're using that so far, generally, it's working good, but we'll see once, once we work it with it for a few more weeks, we use Titan AI. We use trying to think, well, so I've got, we use titanverse, not so much in the past, but going forward, we're looking to use it more. So yes, we do. Oh gosh, yeah, batch flow is amazing. The team can, you know the dispenser will sit there with 20 odd baskets working away, and it's such a time efficient way of dispensing, because she's going to, for instance, if she's dispensing fast lines, she's going to atorvatatin once for maybe seven or eight baskets, instead of seven or eight times. So it's such a better way of working. We also use repeat flow, which means that with North West London, we're not allowed to put repeats in automatically for any patient, but we do for our trade patients, but we now know that every four weeks, they'll go in automatically and they'll get chased up if an item is missing, and we just have to just check in what's coming when they do come in. So it saved a lot of manual labor there, putting in repeats and chasing up what's missing as well. I would say, with batch flow, you're you're saving about 20 to 30% of your dispensing time, and it's amazing. They the staff love it. Accuracy is definitely better, because we when you're using this scanning method, you are taking away the human error element. So that really helps. However, like any system, you cannot forego your protocols, because there's still ways of an error creeping in. So for instance, if you just look at something like batchflow, if I had a dispenser who was quite happily just scanning and pushing them into any basket, then potentially something's going to go into the wrong basket. So you're as a pharmacist and as a business owner, your focus has to be on making sure the team follows your protocol stringently. So yes, the computer will pick up that this is the right item with with the batch flow, you've got to remember your you might be picking 10 baskets. And now my dispenser has got to make sure she listens, she looks at the label, and she looks at the right basket and puts it in. And then when she's bagging up, she's also making sure that everything she's bagging up has the same patient name on it. So it's those sort of protocols that still have to be stringent, where human error can still creep in. But when I look at overall safety, our near misses have, we probably do about three or four near misses in a month, because the staff, because they're not so working in such a stressed environment now, are more likely to go and pick up the right item in the first place. And then when I look at how many errors have actually gone to the patient in the last three years, we've actually only had one error where protocols weren't followed and two people's prescription items got bagged into the same bag, so it's where human error cracked in so but we can now confidently, now that we we are confident about the system. We if somebody says that you've given us the wrong item, we know does it is impossible, because the system has picked it up, and we can go back and look at the system, see what was scanned, who dispensed it, who checks it, and usually we find that when they the patient thinks, when they've come in, saying, you've given me the wrong item, is actually prescribing error. We have given what was on the prescription, but they weren't expecting that change, we can be more confident that we've got it right, or they might say that, you know, I was expecting three packs, and you've only given two, but Titan is showing me that three individual packs were scanned, and the number of times that they've then gone home and found it under their sofa because they opened the bag up and one had slipped under or something like that. So it's given us the confidence that actually no, it's got to be right. Ultimately, we're here to make sure we work safely. Efficiency is one part of it, but safety is the biggest part of it. And and being able to churn out six and a half 1000 items and be confident that the safety element is is there, and we know we've given the right item. It's, it's feels good that I can now go home and sleep better for it as well. So and, and, and, yeah, I'm still able to carry out all these other services, and that's still happening more or less in the background. So we use Titan AI, and on a daily basis, it's saving it's clinically checking at least 50 to 60% on. The items for me some days even better than that, but I definitely get 50 to 60% out of it, yeah, so I've set it up so that it's going to learn from me, because I'm quite particular about how I like things labeled. I don't even let it learn from my locums. But because of that, I know that when it gets to the labeling stage, it's looking how I want it to look. And sometimes you do notice something come back that a pharmacist has missed. So we then work on the pharmacist to remember to just check that bit. But it's not where AI has missed. It's where a pharmacist might were supposed to have clinically checked it, and something's gone through as TDs instead of three times a day. So But ideally, as a pharmacist, I have more time to spend on clinically checking the ones I need to AI is checking a huge number in the background, but I'm able to walk away without the dispensary coming to a standstill because of that as well. The way I see technology in pharmacy is it's there to supplement our processes, to make the running of a pharmacy, a dispensary and a business, more efficient, but ultimately this job is you cannot run it without humans. The face to face interactions with our patients is what makes a pharmacy. What the systems allow us to do is have more time to give to our patients so that we're not we're more free. We're not stressing about what's going on in the background. If we have to give them a few extra minutes, and sometimes it's just as simple as going to have a chat with them, see how they're getting on, nothing clinical about that interaction. Whereas before you would be like, Okay, you want to talk to me about your lovely flowers growing your garden, but I've got 50 baskets to go and check, whereas I will now be able to, or any one of my team will be able to go and say, just speak to the patient. And I think having that interaction, that human interaction, is probably what allows us to stand out, to to our local community, because they see us as people who are approachable. They see us as people who care and I think most pharmacy teams do care, but we're sometimes so bogged down with processes that we we can't find that time to just have a chat with our patients and and it's then that you can build up that relationship, that rapport, that when things do go wrong, you're able to be there to support that patient, And that in the last three years, we've had three people with mental health issues that have talked about suicide to us, and all I can say is is I'm grateful that they felt that they could come to any one of us in the team to sit and have a chat, to get them the right support, because sometimes people don't know where to go to and that human interaction, that ability for my team to spend that time with with the community, give the community that comfort that the people here will help, and then them taking that step to come here for that help, is what matters. And I think we can't. We mustn't forget that that technology doesn't replace people. Technology allows you to free your people up to be there for the community. Amazing. I went for the suicide thing, no, but honestly, that sticks out. I actually had somebody sitting in here. She'd overdosed and and I'm glad she felt she could come and speak to me. Yeah, and then get the right support.

Speaker 2  33:41  
I think this is part of the question, but I think that it's clearly like a bit of community up here. You've got a post office that's front. You've got the pharmacy at the back. You sell sun

Speaker 1  33:50  
cream. The previous owners were not pharmacists, so they actually built a had a post office with a pharmacy on the side. And I remember when I used to, I used to locum here many, many years ago, and it kind of was just, the pharmacy is just a bit of a side business. So the post office has always been here. It's good to have the post office here because we find that a lot of people want to use both services anyway. It increases your footfall, and it's brilliant when I have to send off my end of the month, because it's just there. So we've taken part in campaigns, and I have had our local MP visitors, and one of the local council has been quite vocal in supporting local pharmacies as well. So that's where our interaction has been with the local MP. I think it's when you engage with these people. First of all, it gives you the opportunity to put out to the community what you as a pharmacy business do offer to the community, but it also allows you to get that feedback from them, because they see so many of their concerns. Tunes that they tell you what your reputation is, because you don't always hear that. So it's good to have that feedback. And as much as we like good feedback, we also want to know where we can improve, because everybody can always improve. But I've got to be honest, I'm glad to hear that most of our patients do like us. Not every day goes well like any any human to human interaction. There'll be days like you saw with the sun cream, where it's not so positive. But I think most of our community, we've got a very generally elderly community here, and they do rely on both the post office and and the services we're providing the pharmacy. And I think just being able to be there for them, give them that support, just be there to chat. Some of them are alone, and just come in for a chat. It's, it's it builds your reputation. It it allows others to realize that you're there for them and that you will give them that time. And I've, I've lost count of how many times people have come in and said, we've come here because x, y and z have said that you're good and you'll help us out. And for me, as a pharmacist, that's why I do this job. Yes, I do want to earn money, and I need to earn money to survive, but I take pride in the fact that people feel they can come to us, and it's something I always say to any team member I take on, is if we deal with our patients the way we would want our family members to be treated, then you're never going to go wrong. We're here to help. We know people might be struggling. They might have all sorts of issues going on, what or they come in and just want to catch up with us, and we should be able to provide that for them. And I think that's why we probably have a good reputation, and the whole team works that way. So it's like I said to you earlier, it's not it's not a one man show, it's not the me game. It's definitely a team effort here. And I think that's why we possibly have a good name out there, and why surgeries even refer people on to us. So, yeah, so, I mean, I used to locom here about 20 odd years ago, and then I left to buy a business in Stevenage. And then when I came back, I came back to locuming, and then when they were retiring, they came to me and said, Would you like to buy I said, Yes, because I live in pinner, so it's around the corner for me here, so but like, I think I've said this already, technology is wonderful, but I could have all the gadgets in here. I could have a robot in here, but the robot is not going to give the community what my staff can give the community. And for me, that that's always paramount, and I think we have to invest in in our staff, because I've often looked around and I see people saying, Oh, I give my pharmacist X amount more, and I give my locum X amount more because they're doing these services for me. And I have, actually, I'll be honest, pushed back on that, because my pharmacist might be good, but without my team, they can't achieve anything. So I actually reward my team for the effort they put in to pushing the services, because without them, I can't achieve what I want to achieve. And I also am mindful of that they bring in so much more than just to the business, more than just dispensing for me, they've got communication skills, they've got hopefully, human kindness in them, that that we need to show to our patients. So I want to tap into their skills, tap into what they want out of the job as well. Because, yes, I might want them to sit there and dispense, but that might not be what they want to do all day long as well. So what is it you want to be involved with. And I we always have a team meeting to to see what's going well the previous week, what needs to be achieved this week. And we're always working together as team. And one of the things I like to to know is what what is going on out there? What can we get involved with? What do you think we need to provide? But what would you like to provide? What? Where do you see yourself and your input into the business going forward as well? Because we can't forget that they're in a career as well. They they have aspirations, and I should be, if I'm their employer, looking at how I can upskill them and get them more involved in the other tasks. So, I mean, I can walk away from this Dispensary for for two, three months, and I know I'll come back to running just as smoothly, because they take pride in their work, and they want to do do well by by not just me as the boss, but to the community. And I think that speaks volumes for for our reputation as well. Why? Why it is what it is so it's freed them up. It's, it's, it's made it you can get so bogged down with processes that it becomes a chore. And I think what Titan has allowed us to do is take away a lot of those mundane processes, make it more streamlined and efficient. And that then frees your team up to work more efficiently. Excuse me. For me, if we talk about digital first pharmacy, then, yes, I think in today's era, we have to embrace technology. We have to embrace systems that help us to operate more efficiently. Digital First has definitely helped us to work more safely as well beyond that, I think we still have to make sure we have the human touch and we have protocols in place so that any area where human error is still likely to creep in is minimized as much as possible. I think my biggest focus is I've been putting this off so much because I've just been bogged down. We had three businesses, and then I was running a covid vaccination Center. In between is my own personal development as an IP so I want to get that started. And the second thing I want to do, because one of my dispensers has shown interest in becoming a technician, so I want to develop her skills and get her through that course as well. So they're the two main areas of focus, as far as services and things go. We're constantly pushing the current ones, but I'm always looking out for new ones. And one of the things I've been thinking about is, is blood tests. So I'm looking at options and seeing how we would incorporate that into into our business at the moment. So I think there's there's apprehension on people who've heard about it but not seen it in action. Because yes, you can look at the screen and think there's so much going on, but when you actually use it, it's so user friendly. I know I will. We as a team, we won't be able to do half the things we do now. And I've heard people sometimes say it's an expensive system. Why should we use it? Well, I've saved money on a second pharmacist because if I were to do the same volume of work that we do today, I definitely would need a second pharmacist. I definitely would need more dispensing help. So you've got to look at, yes, the outlay might be more than some of the PMR systems, but what I can achieve with the system, and critically, the safety aspect of the way Titan works, I would always recommend it to people and go and check it out, go to a pharmacy that uses it, try it out. I've, I've had some people have come and visited us apprehensive about it, and then they've worked with and they thought, yeah, actually this, this is the right way to be working, and this is what we want for our business. So, so if anybody were to ask me whether they should get tight, and I would say 100%

you've got to do it. You.
