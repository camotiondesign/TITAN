I played around properly, I was like, this is bloody good, isn't it so easy and simple, and now, like, probably in the whole pharmacy, I know the software the best. I taught you something, right? You might have taught me stuff, but I know the best, right? So, so like, the amount you learn. And the thing with the software is constantly evolving and changing. You love it. You love it because you have different changes. You see the speed is increasing, and it's stuff you can use. It's like useful stuff. Hi. My name is that by Aslam. I am the owner of Drayton prime pharmacy, and I'm a pharmacist as well, day to day wise, I implementing pharmacy work. I'm not involved at all. I've got, I've got pharmacies there, I've got, I've got people who work to do the job. So it allows me to focus on strategic moves, rather than just be involved into the day to day. And if you're involved in the day to day, you'll never get another side. You won't grow. I'll go and train, or I'll grow and have a chat with someone. It's just ad hoc, no. And then I'll look on online, and I'll find something I'd say that could be useful in the pharmacy. Let me trial that at some point. That's how I come up with some weird ideas. And people think, wow, you've come up with this, or you've brought this in, or how did you bring that in? But the Titans give me that time to do that. And so you do little things. You add in little things into your pharmacy, and it ends up becoming really big and makes big impacts. Prior to Titan, we had ah, pro script connect. So back in those days, we used to print off scripts, print off scripts, rent off scripts, and then print off labels and then check I was just manic. And for a store like this to imagine, if you have to go back to that be chaos, um, I didn't imagine it'd be a thing. I always thought I was the most valuable person. Right stepping back without things falling apart. The Titan gives you the confidence to be able to do that, because you can always look back on the system and get on the phone and speak to people about X, Y and Z, but you don't have to be there day to day, hunting everything. That's not how pharmacy, as it goes for me, nowadays, it's become more hands off. You have to trust the people that you've got in charge,

Unknown Speaker  2:53  
and they make the right moves

Speaker 1  2:56  
and they do the right job. So it gives you a lot of confidence and saves you a lot of time without Titan, I don't think I'd be able to step away. I think I'd have to be a lot more hands on. Observe everything. Look at every process. Titan allows us to streamline our pharmacy workflow so that we get our work done. So you've got to imagine we are a 32,000 item pharmacy per month. That's 4004 times more than most pharmacies. So the workload is like we're doing near 2000 items a day, but we finish everything. So we clear everything. The Owings are normally, typically on a Monday, there'll be 30. By the end of the week, you'll have two Owings. So we're a fisher, we're efficient. Yeah, that's actually cool. Yeah, it doesn't look chaotic outside, does it? No, right? It doesn't look chaotic. Lotus of Jamaican friends, so their mothers were very chilled out, and probably I'm from South London, so when I call this black yo, we won. I don't need to be involved all the time during the work week, because, firstly, I have very good staff members. They know the system quite well, and they're able to contact the system provider, ie Titans, provider, if there's anything that goes wrong, hardly anything goes wrong. So they don't bother me, and

Unknown Speaker  4:40  
they don't need to bother me.

Speaker 1  4:43  
In terms of the system, it's very simple to use. Everything is there, so like, if they need to contact me, they can contact me. My phone's always free, but they don't, um. Trained these guys so I know what they're capable of. They just need to do the daily discipline of doing themselves justice. I can't fault the system. I can't fault them. So why do I have to have any worries in the team at all. I don't need to do it. I think they do the job. So do I think pharmacy should trust their pharmacy owners. Just trust their staff. Of course, that's why you employ them. You should trust every part of the process. So you should have a trust with the wholesalers where you get your goods from, the systems, ie, the PMR system is the staff who are there. If you have trust within the whole thing, then you Why should you worry about any of it? You shouldn't, back in the day we used to just print off scripts. So that's one step, and then print off labels that's another step, and then check that's another step, and then package that's another step. Titan does it streamlines it all in one so, for example, if a walk in patient comes in, you can search on the system. You'll know exactly where that patient is in the workflow, you'll be able to dispense it very quickly the item for them. It makes sense in efficiency. It makes sense in the workflow. It makes sense in terms of saving you time. If you save yourself time on the actual system, then you can devote it on other areas that most pharmacy owners dream of, like services. Pharmacy first, a lot of people get bogged down with the daily dispensing, and that's the problem. You need to think outside the box, and Titan helps do that. I think most people working in pharmacy generally just take over a pharmacy and keep things the same. They don't have time to strategically think about making changes here or there, because you've got to, you've got to understand, it's a big investment buying a pharmacy. Most people will be spending up 400,000 on a pharmacy, and then you have to spend on the stock, so it's a lot of money tied in, and you can't just make experimental decisions which can go wrong. So that's why it's a worry for most people. That's why you need people outside. You need to see what other people have done, and when you see what other people are done, that's what gives other people confidence, ie, most owners, confidence to make changes. So if they see that x has done, well, then they'll say, Okay, how have they done that? And then, like, for example, here in this pharmacy, we've we changed the system so we grew in items quite, quite like doubled, basically. So from 16 to 32 that's quite big change. Some places they buy a robot, and you'll see a change, but you won't see the same type of change. So the system does make a massive difference, but a lot of owners need to make that decision, and they need to have that confidence that they're making the right decision. Titan, PMR was adopted like four years ago, and if you look back on our figures, you'll see the difference. It like springs up almost instantaneously. It doubles. I think Titan is a major contributor. The staff being able to implement it and use it and go with it is the other contributor. And just us as a pharmacy where we adopted the system and we went with it. We tried. We didn't go back. We went with it. We didn't have any what you call barriers. We trusted it. And so after a while, you get more and more familiar than you, then it's like a piece of cake. Oh God, sorry, angelic, isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  9:20  
Arrog, Jamaica, Mother, I

Speaker 1  9:21  
Titan has various different functions, but the one that I would say we take for granted, but it's probably the most essential part, is location of prescription. So for example, once you've done all the prescription you dispensed it, you need to package it, yes, sign it to the shelf. In the days gone by, we used to have to hunt down prescriptions. It was a nightmare. But if the process is all done properly, you. Can find a prescription on Titan within a minute, less than a minute, 30 seconds, and people have confidence in that they love that, right? You can tell everyone exactly where their prescription is. I remember early days with towards the end of proscript. We had Owings galore, like 200 Owings. And the Owens used to, used to have, like a bag with the prescription tied to it. And I said, go to a customer, and used to dread if they used to dread it, because you had to true for 200 bags. And like, you'd find one, and you'd be like, it's knowing, God, am I going to tell this person? Whereas now you can say to the person, it's been ordered, it'll be in tomorrow, and they have confidence in that this isn't so much a feature. This is the layout of Titan. So you have the main page where you have, like, the Owings, how much prescriptions, and it's the main page. And then you have the actual page where your prescription board, it's just tells you if there's work to be done, or work has been done, or how much it just is so simple, simple to graph. You can just have one look at it, and you know exactly where your team is. Titan AI, when it first came out, a lot of the pharmacists were very apprehensive. They were like, it's taken over our job. It's taken over our clinical checking job. And I was like, Well, to be honest, it helps you free your time, right? I'm not replacing you anytime soon with Titan AI, it's here to help you. It's a tool for you guys, so just use it. Just last week, one of the guys switched it on, and he said, my day's been so much easier. Like it's fantastic. He had used Titan AI early on, and he had a negative block on it, and he used it against last week because I said, we're going to try it. And he tried it, and he said, fantastic. Like, it's actually really good. And the speed of the board and how quickly everything's working, it's actually really impressive. So you kind of change haters into believers, and that's what you want proscript, you have to have eyes at the back of your head, right? So Titan AI, compared to we've had two systems, I think, RX web at one point and proscript Connect. And from what I remember with both of those systems, you have to have eyes in the back of your head. You have to know exactly what your staff is doing, right? So, for example, because there, you can print off a script, print off the label, and it's untrackable. After that, it will disappear. You don't know what's happened with it until the customer comes. Then you're in big trouble. I would tie it to now Eva, it's you can search it on the system. You know whether someone's messed up or, you know whether it's over here. You know you can track a prescription and tie it in like it's got good audit trail and there's nowhere to hide. So that is fantastic, from my point of view, because then I can give the customer confidence and make sure they get their item, which is what they're here for, with the previous system. No, if it's forgotten gone, and the customer never comes in, nothing's happening the way we address things. Yes, it has, actually, because before, we used to worry about workflow and whether it was going to get done or not get done on the same day, whereas now it's like what we're going to do for tomorrow. How are we going to plan for this? When you speak to the team, there are a lot more calmer you can have these conversations, whereas before you couldn't have these conversations. It's just tense and work and because there's no time. Yeah, there's different no time. You're either printing scripts before, or you're printing labels or you're picking stock. There's no time here. You've got time because you know you'll get stuff done. You've got, you've got confidence that you get stuff done. A lot of other owners, or people in general, they don't plan. They don't have a strategic plan. And if you don't have a plan, you are the plan means someone's going to come in and destroy your business. They're going to have the plan, and you're going to be part of their plan. So you must have a plan. And technology is like a tool. It's like a knife. You can either use it for bad purposes, or you can use it to help you. And that's that's how you should see technology. That's how you should see everything. Think, and if you see it that way, it would just add to what you want to do in terms of your plan, I think taking over pharmacy and the worry, it's all to do with the person, whether a person is closed minded or open minded. Because reality is, if we're still stuck in the past will never go forward. And you're in, you're in a generation stop, whereas, for example, if you're open minded, you're always open to change. And if change is always going to happen, whatever you whoever you think you're going to stand still, change is always going to happen. And the people who strive and succeed are the ones who handle change well. So I think generally it's a person thing rather than a technology thing. I think they're already falling behind because they can't see where they're going. If you look rowland's paper base, they're not going forward. Boots were paper based, not going forward. You've got a lot of problems in these it's they're not looking at efficiencies that they can say and the times change now, time has changed. So technology, like in 50 years time, the technology has changed all the way through. So why are we still paper based? I don't understand it. I really don't. I don't want anyone to get tighter. It's a it's a strange decision that I would say to all my competitors in and around this area, don't get tighter. Stay paper based, and stay in your zone, because we can take over, and we're happy to take over. Oh, no, nobody cut down. It's like a race was slow, also referred to as pictures. Do you know what? At the time we were getting Titan, we were either gonna get a refill or get Titan. That was the two choices, refit, or Titan. And I went with Titan, and I didn't need a refit, because Titan saved me a lot of time and effort and money on that. And then the choice was robot or Titan. And I looked it and I weighed it out, and I thought, well, I don't need a robot. I don't need a 300,000 pound robot. I've got Titan. It does a job for me per day. It does the job. I get everything done. How much time does? It accumulates to save, savings. So, for example, probably about three or four staff members. It saves makes up for three or four staff members, I think generally, Titan offers you savings you can't see. So for example, before we used to have a lot more staff members with after implementing Titan other, I can comfortably say that we've saved three members of SLA as full time members of staff. That's saving in itself. That's true. So the focus over the next year is to grow our services. We have confidence in our dispensers inside, but to grow our services and to improve our quality of service, that would be what we're looking to go well, we do the most pharmacy, first in the area, right here. That's not even drying,

Unknown Speaker  18:36  
right? We did a micro section.

Speaker 1  18:40  
We do NMSS now titanverse With NMS is fantastic. It's we get what near 300 done, 350 roughly we got, we got near 350 we can get done on that around here, this area, pharmacy first is just a recent one year. NMS is we grew into it after titanverse, before titanverse, we weren't, but after titanverse, we were. I think we're second to AR pharmacy. I don't know what PMR system they use. Put this way, like, at one point we were, like, 19th in the country for something. I can't remember. What was it? Prescription numbers. I think, I think there's prescription numbers, but that was during our period where we weren't looking at growing that's a funny one, isn't it, Drayton prime pharmacy is known as a destination pharmacy. So when people go to most use your regular pharmacy and they don't find an item in stock, they'll come to Drayton prime pharmacy, and then they'll just sign up and stay here, and that's why we call it a destination pharmacy. You don't know what after hours mean. Do you

Unknown Speaker  19:49  
we're

Unknown Speaker  19:51  
open eight, eight. Now we were open 830

Unknown Speaker  19:55  
to 1030.

Unknown Speaker  19:57  
11, right? Okay, 11.

Speaker 1  20:01  
Yeah, and after hours is after 11, so sometimes two o'clock in the morning just to get stuff done, finished before Titan. Yeah, yeah, before Titan, you'd be there till two o'clock in the morning. And I had a staff member who turned around looked at me and said, This is hell. And then a month after we got Titan, they looked at me and said, we can go home on time. And that was a major difference, like and having spoken to that guy recently, I said, I will never go back to that, staying after hours. I'll never go back to that, I said. And I said to them you're a weak man like drayen Prime is a modern pharmacy that runs whether you're there or you're not there, just gets the job done. And that's mainly down to the system and the staff who operate the system. If you're looking to switch to Titan, I think it's a hands on approach. You need to actually start doing it all yourself as well. Make sure you're involved and you're you're able to look at all the steps so that you can train anyone afterwards, once you know the system and you can train everyone

Unknown Speaker  21:17  
else, then you can step back.

Speaker 1  21:20  
That was great. Yeah. Is there anything else that you'd like to add? Is there anything else other things? I think, I think with the system, you you forget that there's a lot of basics, but they make big difference. If you'd have worked in a pharmacy, you'd be like, Hi, I'm Akbar slam. This is Drayton prime pharmacy. We've been around for about 1213, years now. I.
