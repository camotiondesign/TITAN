Speaker 1  0:01  
So Yousef, Lauren, this is the seventh site to go live with the BNP. How do you think it's gone? It's

Speaker 2  0:08  
gone well, so far, this is the biggest site yet. So 25,000 items has been our biggest challenge. But the staff have taken well to it. They're understanding slowly, the process and onwards and upwards. So how many more sites have you got left with us? Still another five to go, or the biggest challenge to come? So this one was with the robots, and we said it was the biggest site.

Unknown Speaker  0:33  
Did you think feel it went? Okay,

Speaker 2  0:34  
yeah. So far so good. Obviously, we had a little bit of trouble with robot implementation on day one, but it allowed everyone a bit of time to use Titan to get used to it, doing it manually, without the robot in that time. And yeah, so far so good. So

Speaker 1  0:50  
Lauren, you're an ICT and you're one of the managers here. How do you think it's gone

Speaker 3  0:54  
few TV problems to start with, been pro script through and through for the last sort of 1015, years. The transition was, has to be expected, quite hard to begin with, but everybody took it on board, and I think going forward, it would be great. So

Speaker 1  1:13  
as an ICT, what benefits do you see for you as an individual? I think it frees up a lot of time

Unknown Speaker  1:20  
for a CTS, obviously, the accuracy is there as well. And

Speaker 1  1:23  
I know this is a very busy store and you've been a bit stressed. Would you recommend this to other pharmacies?

Unknown Speaker  1:29  
Yousef, well, you already know that I would.

Speaker 1  1:33  
And I can see you've got the Titan hoodie on there as well. Oh, you noticed that, dude. Yes, we did. If you give me a twill as well. Yes, there we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:42  
Okay, would you like any leave any other feedback for us?

Speaker 2  1:45  
Yeah, definitely. Imagine, imagine us. Have been fantastic throughout this whole process for us from the beginning to end, and I know that they're still going to be here for a few weeks, helping on, you know, remotely, taking the time with the staff is the main thing. And being there to say, what do you need? Do you know, or do you need any more help with this? Or, you know, just simply, just standing around there, just to be in the vicinity, in case someone does need them, that's been the

Speaker 1  2:12  
best part. So Lauren, have you got any feedback regarding the training over the last couple of days? I think the

Speaker 3  2:18  
trainings been great. Especially, we've got a few members of staff that are not so tech savvy. So to have all these new systems and computers and devices in place, it's been a bit daunting for some of them, but having the guys on hand to help with that has been it's been really useful. Well, I just want

Speaker 1  2:38  
to say thank you for your hospitality. It's been fantastic meeting you guys and always show with a

Unknown Speaker  2:43  
success. Real. Thanks.
