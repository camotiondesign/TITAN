Okay, hi, Anup, hi, hello. So this is your eighth pharmacy that you're having title with. Yeah, has your implementation been so far?

Speaker 2  0:08  
Yeah, it's been the challenge in places, but with the support of the trading team, of that coming on site has been very good. Again, it gives us opportunity for the staff to ask questions directly and learn directly as well.

Unknown Speaker  0:25  
Why did you choose Titan?

Unknown Speaker  0:27  
Chose Titan because

Speaker 2  0:30  
I think from we were looking at even other PMR systems, it was allowing us to see the benefit in the sense of like, allowed to like, follow the processes with the team working together. It allows us to free up pharmacist time. So with the direction pharmacies heading now, with the pharmacy first services and other private services that you need to buy up time for the pharmacist to be able to do these. So can you

Unknown Speaker  0:53  
see the benefits with it? Yes,

Speaker 2  0:55  
we can. Yeah, like I said, obviously, as a pharmacist myself, you'd ever seen less work coming towards my way. So I'm able to do more services again, so it's

Speaker 1  1:05  
working out pretty well. Any regrets so far? No, not really. No, no, something won't look after you got this is a eighth one. We got three more to go, yes, and then hopefully you're tighten all the way through. Definitely. Yep. How you liking your new hoodie?

Speaker 2  1:21  
That's nice giving me warm, especially with the cold weather challenge to get these while we got them, and you're

Speaker 1  1:28  
part of the Titan team now. Yeah, definitely. Thank you so much for today. Hope it all goes well for you and your team. Thank you. Thanks.
