Hi, kanav, I can see you offer a variety of different services, such as weight management, travel, health, clinic, pharmacy, first services, earwax removal and many more. Can I ask how you manage all of that?

Speaker 2  0:18  
Thanks for the question. Ha, yeah. So as you could see, we do a lot of services. You really want to know how we do this. We only do it because of Titan. So since day one, it's a brand new shop. It's a brand new business for me. Since day one, I've always had Titan, and it makes me do a lot of other services and generate revenue on that, and purely it's because of Titan, the way it works, the way it's designed, it lets me do all of that, and I have my personal time. I have time to do all a lot of other things and a lot of other services, which we offer in our store. So yeah, thanks to Titan. You

Speaker 1  0:58  
seem to be pretty relaxed. How do you have so much time. Well

Speaker 2  1:01  
again, Titans helping me a lot with my dispensing so on daily basis, the way we work, I'm only doing my clinical tricks, and I leave the rest for my dispensing team to dispense it, bag it, file it and hand it out. Meanwhile, I do all my other services in the consultation rooms such as air, wax removal, travel, health, weight loss, and all the other sorts. And all because of Titan,

Speaker 1  1:27  
the last pharmacy I worked at, used to claim prescriptions all day long and get behind dispensing. But I don't do claiming here. Why is that? Well,

Speaker 2  1:35  
partially, a lot of other pharmacies, they have a lot of different softwares, but through Titan, all you do is you click on one claim, and it claims all the prescriptions for the day. So then that means you're free to do dispensing. You're free to do all the other things Kaya, and you can get on with all the other customer services and all the other services that we provide in our store. So which is why we have a lot of time to do other things, other than just keep scanning the prescription all day long and do claiming. So that's why all the claiming is done through me in one go.

Speaker 1  2:12  
And last question, kind of would you recommend Titan to other people? Oh,

Speaker 2  2:16  
yes, certainly, from day one, if you have Titan in place, you know, you have a lot of good efficiency for workflow, and IT manager. It lets you manage all the items, all the dispensary flow, for the prescriptions. And I've to be honest, I've as a brand new business, I've had really good response from the community saying your services are really efficient, and that's purely because of Titan, the way it works, the way it lets me do what I need to do. And because one patient comes in, all the bags are ready for collection, and everything's given out in one go, and that helps improve the efficiency of the business, and we grow eventually, I.
