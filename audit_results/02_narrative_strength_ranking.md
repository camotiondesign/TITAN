## Exceptional Tier (Top Performers)


## Recommendations

### For Weak/Minimal Posts
1. Add named individuals (pharmacists, pharmacy names)
2. Use concrete problems (baskets, items, scripts) not abstract challenges
3. Include specific metrics (numbers, timeframes, outcomes)
4. Complete story arcs (hook → conflict → resolution)
5. Add emotional language (proud, frustrated, calm, burnout)
6. Use narrative devices (before-after, problem-solution, testimonial)

### Common Gaps
- **Character presence**: 37 posts have no named individuals
- **Conflict clarity**: 61 posts use abstract problems
- **Specificity**: 21 posts lack concrete details
