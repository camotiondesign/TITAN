    "caption": "From overflowing baskets\n\nTo calm, scalable pharmacy in weeks\n\nThis is what happens when a system finally helps carry the weight.\n\nPharmacies aren't failing to grow.\nThey're trying to scale on tools that weren't built for it.\n\nEvery extra item means extra effort\nunless your PMR is built to handle more.\n\nAt Titan, we've seen the same story across the UK: bit.ly/3GPxjnN \n\n\u2022 Teams stretched too thin\n\u2022 Baskets stacking up\n\u2022 Owners forced to hire just to keep up\n\nThen they switch to Titan:\n\n\u2022 AI clears up to 90% of scripts\n\u2022 Pharmacists step off the bench\n\u2022 Dispensers run workflow with confidence\n\u2022 Volumes rise\n\u2022 Stress falls\n\nThis is what happens when your team gets backup. Not burnout.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See how others scaled smarter: \n\n#CommunityPharmacy #PharmacyBusiness #SmartGrowth #TitanPMR #PharmacyWorkflow #DigitalPharmacy #AIinPharmacy\n\n\n\n",
