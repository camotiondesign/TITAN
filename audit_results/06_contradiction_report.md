## Unified Framing Recommendations

### AI Capabilities
**Unified description**: "AI that handles routine checks, giving pharmacists backup for what matters. Not replacing judgment. Supporting it."

**Key principles**:
- AI = backup, not replacement
- AI handles routine, humans handle complex
- AI = safety layer, not automation layer
- Always frame as "AI supports" not "AI does"

**Avoid**:
- "AI automates" (implies replacement)
- "AI replaces" (threatening)
- "AI does everything" (unrealistic)

**Use instead**:
- "AI clears routine checks"
- "AI gives you backup"
- "AI handles the repetitive, you handle the complex"

### TITAN PMR vs TITANVERSE
**Clear positioning statement**: 
- **TITAN PMR**: The pharmacy management system. Core dispensing, workflow, safety. For today's pharmacy operations.
- **TITANVERSE**: The health hub platform. Services, prescribing, patient care. For tomorrow's pharmacy services.

**Separation rules**:
- TITAN PMR posts: Focus on dispensing, workflow, efficiency, safety
- TITANVERSE posts: Focus on services, prescribing, health hub, future of pharmacy
- If both mentioned: Lead with primary product, mention other as "also available" or "part of the ecosystem"

**Avoid**:
- Blurring the products in TITAN PMR posts
- Positioning TITANVERSE as "the future of TITAN PMR" (they're different products)
- Using TITANVERSE features to sell TITAN PMR

### Feature Descriptions
**Consistent framing**:

**AI Checks**:
- ❌ "AI automates checking"
- ✅ "AI clears routine checks, pharmacists verify complex cases"

**Batch Processing**:
- ❌ "Automated batching"
- ✅ "Smart batching that groups scripts efficiently"

**Safety Features**:
- ❌ "Safety features included"
- ✅ "Safety built into every workflow"

**Scale/Growth**:
- ❌ "Handles any volume"
- ✅ "Built to scale without breaking"

## Corrected Lines

### Example 1: AI Positioning
**Before**: "AI automates 90% of dispensing checks"
**After**: "AI clears 90% of routine checks, giving pharmacists time for complex cases"

**Before**: "AI replaces manual checking"
**After**: "AI handles routine checks, pharmacists focus on what needs human judgment"

### Example 2: TITANVERSE Mentions in TITAN Posts
**Before**: "TITAN PMR now includes TITANVERSE health hub features"
**After**: "TITAN PMR handles your core dispensing. TITANVERSE (available separately) extends into health services."

### Example 3: Safety Framing
**Before**: "TITAN has safety features"
**After**: "Safety is built into TITAN's architecture, not added as features"

### Example 4: Scale Claims
**Before**: "TITAN handles unlimited volume"
**After**: "TITAN scales with your growth, from 1,000 to 20,000+ items monthly"
