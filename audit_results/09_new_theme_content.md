# Phase 9: New Theme Creation

## Unused Angles Identified

- **Regulation**: Not yet covered
- **Compliance**: Not yet covered
- **Training/Implementation**: Not yet covered as standalone theme

## Selected Theme: The Implementation Experience

### Strategic Rationale

**Why this theme aligns with goals**:
1. **Addresses key objection**: "Switching PMRs is too disruptive" - this theme shows it's not
2. **Differentiates on execution**: Most PMR vendors talk features, few talk implementation
3. **Builds trust**: Transparent about the process, not just the outcome
4. **Creates urgency**: Shows that switching is easier than staying stuck
5. **Social proof**: Implementation stories are powerful testimonials

**Strategic value**:
- Removes barrier to switching
- Positions TITAN as easy to adopt
- Shows care for pharmacy operations (not just selling software)
- Creates content series opportunity (implementation journey)

## New Content Created

### Single-Image Caption (50-70 words)
```
Switching PMRs doesn't have to mean chaos.

Most pharmacies go live in days, not months.

Your team gets trained. Your data migrates. Your workflow adapts.

Then you're running on a system built for how pharmacy actually works.

No downtime. No disruption. No "we'll figure it out later."

Just a better way to work.
