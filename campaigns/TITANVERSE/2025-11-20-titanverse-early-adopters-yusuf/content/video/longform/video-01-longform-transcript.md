Before Titanverse, everything was manual. Everything was on paper.  
Doing a consultation like that now, it actually feels pretty impersonal when you think about it.

We were one of the early adopters of Titanverse.  
As soon as we saw it at the Pharmacy Show 2023, I made it clear to the team that I wanted us to be one of the first to use it.

NMS was the first live module.  
It meant we could centralise everything at head office. Only one pharmacist needed to complete them, but it was visible to all senior management.

The AI is genuinely the best thing I've ever seen.  
I couldn't believe how easy it was to create templates for every service using voice transcription.

It highlights the questions the patient has answered.  
If you've missed something, it leaves it open so you can clearly see that you haven't asked that question.

Once the consultation is done, it gives you a complete summary.  
Then the AI suggests what the next steps should be.

And it's not just learning from Google.  
In the UK, we use NICE, we use the Green Book.

The team at Titan have done a brilliant job making sure it's a closed system, fed only with the right clinical information.

No matter what level of experience you have, it still surprises you.  
I've been a prescriber for three years. Our director has been a prescriber for well over ten.

Even now, using Titanverse, it makes you think:  
"Oh wow… we need to level up here."
