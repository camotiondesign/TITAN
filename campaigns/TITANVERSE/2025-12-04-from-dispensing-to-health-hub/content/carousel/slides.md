# Carousel Slides – POV: Running a Service-Led Health Hub

## Slide 1 – Hook
- **On-slide text:**  
  Two pharmacies. Same building.
  
  Very different future.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Side-by-side split screen visual contrast. Left side: "Dispensing-Led Pharmacy" with single tall red bar labeled "Dispensing" (vertical text, bottom to top) and character/pharmacist standing beneath looking stressed, surrounded by chaotic dispensary elements (paper forms scattered, prescription baskets stacked high, queue of patients visible, manual processes). Right side: "Service-Led Health Hub" with three balanced bars of equal height: "NHS Clinical Services" (teal-green), "Private Services" (purple gradient #FF65DD → #B752FF, tallest), "Dispensing" (blue, shorter) and character/pharmacist standing beneath looking confident (hand on hip, slight smile), in organized consultation setting with digital interface visible. Character wears purple suit (Titanverse brand) with white ID badge on lanyard. Vertical divider between sides. Headline "Two pharmacies. Same building. Very different future." in bold, large typography at top (black or white depending on background). Titanverse purple accent/branding. Clean white or light gradient background. Visual matches blog's comparison graphic concept. Strong visual contrast creates immediate curiosity.

## Slide 2 – Problem/Pain
- **On-slide text:**  
  Dispensing alone is no longer sustainable.
  
  "We are not chasing items anymore. We are about service."
- **Alt text / description:**  
  **ALTERNATIVE 1 (Problem Focus - Recommended):** Single powerful visual focusing on the problem. Chaotic dispensary scene: stressed pharmacist buried in baskets of prescriptions stacked high, paper forms scattered everywhere, manual processes visible (printing, filing), queue of patients waiting. Red color coding: red X marks indicating problems, red accents on chaotic elements. Background: light grey/white with red problem indicators. Quote text displayed prominently: "We are not chasing items anymore" in faded/grey, "We are about service" in bold, highlighted color (Titanverse purple gradient #FF65DD → #B752FF). Visual emphasizes the pain point without needing to show solution yet. Similar to AI Templates carousel (58.0% engagement) - shows problem first, solution comes later. More focused and impactful than side-by-side.
  
  **ALTERNATIVE 2 (Visual Metaphor):** Stacks of prescription baskets, paper forms, and manual processes piled high. Overwhelmed visual metaphor. Red color coding for problems. Quote overlaid or positioned prominently. Clean, focused on the problem. No solution shown yet - creates tension and curiosity for next slides.
  
  **ALTERNATIVE 3 (Text-Focused):** Strong typography as primary visual. Large, bold quote text: "We are not chasing items anymore" in faded/grey, "We are about service" in bold, highlighted Titanverse purple gradient. Minimal visual elements (maybe subtle chaotic background pattern or prescription icon). Clean, professional design. Similar to Your Pharmacy Isn't Struggling carousel (53.4% engagement) - typography creates impact.

## Slide 3 – Structure
- **On-slide text:**  
  Your day starts with appointments, not items.
  
  NMS. Travel Health. IP Clinics. Private services.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Product UI screenshot or calendar interface mockup showing Titanverse console. Morning schedule view with consultation time slots filled: "9:00 AM - NMS" (filled slot), "10:30 AM - Travel Health" (filled slot), "2:00 PM - IP Clinic" (filled slot), "3:30 PM - Private Service" (filled slot). Calendar grid or timeline view with appointments scheduled throughout the day. Icons representing different service types: stethoscope (NMS/Clinical Services), globe (Travel Health), prescription pad (IP Clinics), consultation/chat icon (Private Services). Clean, organized digital interface. Titanverse purple console UI theme (#FF65DD → #B752FF gradient). Modern, digital interface aesthetic. Background: dark purple-to-black gradient (Titanverse cosmic theme) or clean white with purple UI elements. No dispensing queue visible (emphasizing shift). Similar to POV Consultation carousel's product UI style (76.8% engagement, 73.8% CTR).

## Slide 4 – Unified Workflow
- **On-slide text:**  
  One console: Booking → Consult → AI Notes → Prescribing → Follow-up
  
  All connected. All designed for pharmacy.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Workflow diagram with connected icons/steps (left to right): 1. Booking icon (calendar) - "Booking", 2. Consultation icon (stethoscope/mic) - "Consult", 3. AI Notes icon (document/sparkle) - "AI Notes", 4. Prescribing icon (prescription pad) - "Prescribing", 5. Follow-up icon (checkmark/arrow) - "Follow-up". All connected with flowing arrows or lines in Titanverse purple gradient (#FF65DD → #B752FF). Smooth, seamless flow visual. Product UI mockup showing unified console interface with all features visible in one view. Modern, clean design. Visual emphasizes seamless flow and connection between all steps. Similar to AI Templates carousel's workflow progression style (58.0% engagement). Icons are clear, universally understood symbols.

## Slide 5 – Revenue Model
- **On-slide text:**  
  NHS services + Private services + Dispensing = Sustainable model
  
  Balanced. Not dependent.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Visual chart/graphic showing revenue mix. Three balanced bars (horizontal or vertical): Bar 1: "NHS Clinical Services" (blue, medium height), Bar 2: "Private Services" (purple gradient #FF65DD → #B752FF, medium height), Bar 3: "Dispensing" (teal-green, medium height). All three bars equal height (showing balance). Side-by-side or stacked arrangement. Clean, professional chart design. Optional: numbers or percentages, "+" symbols between services, "=" symbol before "Sustainable model". Contrast element: old model shown faded/greyed out in background (single tall red bar labeled "Dispensing", faded, transparent, showing what it's replacing). Visual emphasizes balanced, sustainable model (not dependent on one revenue stream). Similar to 5 Ways AI carousel's graphic style (45.5% engagement).

## Slide 6 – Proof/Outcome
- **On-slide text:**  
  "We are not chasing items anymore. We are about service. That is what pharmacy should be."
  
  — Superintendent
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Clean, minimal quote slide. Quote text displayed prominently in large, readable typography, centered or left-aligned. Color contrast for emphasis: "chasing items" text in faded/grey color (old model), "about service" text in bold, highlighted color (Titanverse purple gradient #FF65DD → #B752FF), "That is what pharmacy should be." in standard color (white or black). Attribution "— Superintendent" in smaller text below (italic or smaller font, subtle, professional). Background: clean white or light gradient (white to very light purple). Optional: subtle Titanverse purple accent (gradient element, sparkle, or logo). Minimal design, no clutter. Professional, trustworthy aesthetic. Similar to Your Pharmacy Isn't Struggling carousel's text-focused style (53.4% engagement) but with color contrast for emphasis.

## Slide 7 – CTA
- **On-slide text:**  
  Read the full blog: bit.ly/4aylIWL
  
  The health hub era is already taking shape.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Clean, focused CTA slide. Blog link "bit.ly/4aylIWL" displayed prominently with arrow or link icon next to URL, large, readable font, Titanverse purple gradient (#FF65DD → #B752FF) for link text. Closing message "The health hub era is already taking shape." in supporting text (smaller font, but still readable, white or black depending on background). Titanverse purple branding/logo, subtle gradient elements. Background: clean white or light gradient (white to very light purple). Optional: forward momentum visual (subtle arrow or progression element). Minimal design, focused on action. No distracting elements. Professional, modern aesthetic. Similar to Priory carousel's CTA slide style (111% engagement).
