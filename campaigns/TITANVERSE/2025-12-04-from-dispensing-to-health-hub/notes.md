### Campaign Notes — From Dispensing to Health Hub

This is a positioning and reframing campaign. It speaks to the strategic and commercial reality facing independent pharmacy: dispensing alone is no longer sustainable as a business model. The campaign connects the shift directly to technology infrastructure — Titan PMR creates the capacity, Titanverse converts it into clinical and commercial value.

Why it matters:

- Provides narrative context for Titanverse launch.

- Frames private services as patient-driven, not opportunistic.

- Positions early adopters as leaders, not outliers.

- Aligns with NHS 10-Year Plan language around access, continuity, and prevention.
