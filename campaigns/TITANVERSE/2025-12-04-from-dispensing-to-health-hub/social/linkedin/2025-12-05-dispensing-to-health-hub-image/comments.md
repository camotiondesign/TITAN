## Top-Level Comments

**Hooman Ghalamkari — Chief Operations Officer for Implementations, Invatech Health Ltd**  
"The direction of travel is clear for community pharmacy, but how do you get there?  

The first step is to change dispensary workflows, so that staff are empowered, technology is used for accuracy and pharmacists are not involved in everything. TITAN PMR  

Then focus on efficient service delivery using a platform that leverages integration with your PMR and has everything you need, from bookings, to consultation to payments. TITANVERSE"
