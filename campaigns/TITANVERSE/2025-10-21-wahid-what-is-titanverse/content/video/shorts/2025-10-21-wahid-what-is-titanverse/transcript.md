# Short Clip Transcript – Wahid What is Titanverse

**Wahid:**  
So what is Titanverse? Titanverse is the new platform we built specifically for pharmacy services. You already know the story. We created Titan PMR to help pharmacists step out of the dispensary and into clinical care. But now there's a new set of problems. Systems are fragmented, disjointed with multiple subscriptions. It's just all over the place, and that makes it hard to deliver pharmacy services and even harder to scale. That's why we built Titanverse. It brings everything together and uses AI to take the pressure off. You can use AI to generate service specific templates in seconds, tailored to how you work using our built in AI scribe. It listens during your consultation, writes the notes for you, no typing, just speaking and prescribing. It's built right in. Create prescriptions, digitally sign them and send them off to the pharmacy for dispensing. We've even got clinical pathways powered by them dx, so you've got structured, safe decision support right when you need it. But that's not all, calendars, bookings, pre consults, payments, documents, referrals, AI agents, all in one simple flow. And of course, it's fully compliant if you're running pharmacy services or you want to Titan versus built for you.
