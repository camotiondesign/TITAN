## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Clear benefit-driven messaging:** Animated video effectively communicated batch dispensing speed and safety benefits
- **Reinforces "time is the currency" narrative tied to services:** Content successfully connected batch dispensing to service expansion
- **Animated branded style recognised:** Branded animation format stood out and was recognised
- **Strong organic engagement:** 99 engagements from organic traffic indicates strong interest

### What Didn't Work

- **Sponsored spend delivered minimal uplift:** Only 51 additional impressions from £291.76 spend
- **eCPM unusually high:** £291.76 eCPM indicates inefficient spend
- **No sponsored engagement:** 0 engagements from 51 sponsored impressions
- **Feature-focused ads convert poorly:** Without warm touchpoint, feature promotion didn't resonate with cold audience

### Audience Insights

- **Organic audience engaged:** Strong organic performance (99 engagements) indicates warm audience interest
- **Cold audience didn't convert:** Sponsored traffic showed no engagement, suggesting feature-focused ads need warm touchpoint
- **Short sponsor period:** 1-day boost may have been too short for effective reach
- **Feature promotion needs context:** Feature-focused content performs better with testimonials or social proof

---

## Recommendations

### For Future Similar Campaigns

- **Use testimonials next to feature promotion:** Combine feature promotion with user testimonials for social proof
- **Run sponsor AFTER organic traction:** Boost posts after they've gained organic momentum, not immediately
- **Add social proof inside the animation ("Batch used by X pharmacies"):** Include usage statistics or social proof in video
- **Test longer sponsor periods:** Extend sponsored duration for better reach and engagement

### Content Adjustments

- **Keep:** Clear benefit messaging, animated format, time-saving narrative, service connection
- **Add:** Testimonials, social proof, usage statistics, longer sponsor periods
- **Test:** Testimonial + feature combinations, social proof overlays, retargeting strategies

### Process Improvements

- **Sponsored timing strategy:** Develop process for boosting after organic traction rather than immediately
- **Feature promotion templates:** Create templates combining features with testimonials or social proof
- **Cost efficiency review:** Review eCPM and adjust targeting/strategy for better efficiency
- **Warm audience targeting:** Develop retargeting strategies for feature-focused content

---

## Next Steps

- Test testimonials next to feature promotion
- Run sponsor AFTER organic traction in future campaigns
- Add social proof inside animation ("Batch used by X pharmacies")
- Review sponsored strategy for better cost efficiency
- Develop feature + testimonial combination templates

---

## Campaign Context

**Key Insight:**
Sponsored spend delivered minimal uplift with unusually high eCPM. Feature-focused ads convert poorly without warm touchpoint.

**Significance:**
This campaign successfully promoted TITAN Batch through animated video, demonstrating strong organic engagement but highlighting the need for better sponsored strategy. The high eCPM (£291.76) and zero sponsored engagement indicate that feature-focused promotional content requires warm touchpoints (testimonials, social proof) or should be boosted after organic traction rather than immediately. The campaign reinforces the "time is the currency" narrative and aligns with private service expansion messaging.
