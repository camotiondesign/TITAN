# Short Clip Transcript – Ishpal Testimonial

Honestly, it's been a game changer for me. We've been using Titan in our pharmacy for about a year and a half. I'm able to spend most of my day sitting in the consultation room doing clinical services, while the girls can just get on with things in the dispensary.

I probably spend maybe 20 minutes a day at most in the dispensary, and at most an hour a day doing clinical checks. Titan AI helps me with that. So if I'm busy doing a service with a patient, prescriptions are still being checked in the background, just the way that Titan is designed.

It's really easy to use, really intuitive, and paperless. Other companies or systems that I've used in the past are also trying to do a similar thing, but I really don't think they can do it in the same way.

I've been really impressed with how they ask for user feedback. They really tap into that and listen to users to continue developing the system. So I have no regrets, and it's been a massive game changer for me, like I said.

So, yeah, highly recommend it.
