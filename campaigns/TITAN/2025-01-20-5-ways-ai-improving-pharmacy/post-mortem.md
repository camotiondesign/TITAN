## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Exceptional engagement rate:** 45.5% total engagement rate (48.9% organic) indicates high audience interest in AI education
- **Strong click-through:** 45.0% CTR (48.1% organic) demonstrates strong content relevance and value
- **Educational format resonated:** Carousel format effectively communicated AI benefits with clear structure

### What Didn't Work

- **Limited comments:** Only 1 comment despite high engagement suggests content was consumed but didn't spark discussion

### Audience Insights

- **Educational content performs well:** Carousel format with clear structure and sources resonated strongly
- **Click-through indicates value:** High CTR suggests audience found content valuable and worth exploring
