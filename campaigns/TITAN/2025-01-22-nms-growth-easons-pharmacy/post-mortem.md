## Recommendations

- **Test:** Carousel format, multiple stat variants, testimonial integration

### Process Improvements

- **CTA template:** Develop template for adding CTAs to stat graphics

## Campaign Context

**Key Insight:**
ROI framing (£3K/month) and clear visual chart resonated strongly. Revenue numbers drive curiosity and stop-scroll.

**Significance:**
This campaign successfully showcased real-world NMS growth and revenue impact through a clear stat graphic. The ROI framing (£3K/month) and 6x growth statistic captured attention and drove curiosity. Strong organic performance (4.6% engagement rate) indicates warm audience interest in ROI content. However, limited sponsored engagement (0.1%) suggests cold audience needs more context. Future campaigns should include CTAs on graphics and timeline context to enhance conversion potential.
