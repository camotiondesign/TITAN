2025 was a year of shared pharmacy moments.

The kind where you see a meme and think: "That's my life."

We've all felt the expanding brain moment—watching pharmacy evolve from retail counter to digital health hub. We've all sat there with baskets piling up, thinking "this is fine" while the system does nothing. We've all considered hiring more staff before realizing the real problem is the system itself.

And let's be honest—we've all had those days where closing time feels like a myth, where Gandalf himself couldn't help you leave on time.

These memes hit because they're true. They capture the frustration, the chaos, the moments where you're trying to choose between peer-to-peer and hub-and-spoke, and your PMR only offers one.

But here's what 2025 also showed us: when the system finally works, everything changes. Pharmacists step off the bench. Teams find their flow. Near misses drop. Time gets freed up.

The memes make us laugh because we've been there. But the real win? Building pharmacies where these memes become outdated.
