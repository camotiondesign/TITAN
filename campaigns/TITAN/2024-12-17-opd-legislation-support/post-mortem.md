## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Timely regulatory relevance:** Posted ahead of January 2025 mandate, providing advance notice
- **Clear feature-value explanation:** Messaging clearly explained what OPD means for pharmacies
- **Reposts indicate industry utility:** 9 reposts suggest content was valuable enough to share with networks
- **Compliance reassurance:** Messaging successfully positioned Titan as ready and compliant

### What Didn't Work

- **Engagement rate modest for regulatory change:** 6.6% engagement rate lower than expected for important regulatory update
- **Static imagery limits depth:** Single graphic cannot convey workflow nuance or demonstrate automation
- **Limited conversation:** Only 1 comment suggests post was informational rather than conversation-starting

### Audience Insights

- **Informational content:** Low comment count suggests audience consumed information but didn't engage in discussion
- **Shareability over engagement:** High repost rate relative to comments indicates content was useful to share but not discuss
- **Regulatory focus:** Content served as announcement/update rather than engagement driver

## Recommendations

### For Future Similar Campaigns

- **Add visual demonstration:** Include 15-second "OPD in action" demo video showing workflow
- **Carousel format:** Create carousel explaining what changes vs what stays the same
- **Downloadable resource:** Offer downloadable OPD checklist as a CTA to drive deeper engagement
- **Multi-format approach:** Combine single-image announcement with video demonstration for better impact

### Content Adjustments

- **Keep:** Timely regulatory messaging, clear feature explanation, compliance reassurance
- **Add:** Visual workflow demonstration, before/after comparison, interactive elements
- **Test:** Video format, carousel format, downloadable resources

### Process Improvements

- **Regulatory content strategy:** Develop template for regulatory updates that includes multiple formats
- **Visual assets:** Invest in animated/video assets for complex workflow explanations
- **Engagement tactics:** Include questions or calls-to-action that encourage discussion

---

## Next Steps

- Create 15-second "OPD in action" demo video for future use
- Develop carousel format explaining OPD changes vs what stays the same
- Create downloadable OPD checklist as lead magnet
- Test video format for future regulatory updates

## Campaign Context

**Key Insight:**
Moderate engagement with strong shareability, as indicated by reposts. Future content should include animation or visual workflow demonstration to enhance clarity and impact.

**Significance:**
This campaign successfully announced Titan's readiness for OPD legislation, but demonstrated that regulatory content benefits from visual demonstration rather than static imagery alone.
