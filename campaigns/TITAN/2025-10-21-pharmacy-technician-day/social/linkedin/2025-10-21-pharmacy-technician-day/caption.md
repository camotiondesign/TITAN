Happy Pharmacy Technician Day 2025 🎉

Thank you for everything you do.

Pharmacy Technicians play a crucial role in every safe, efficient dispensary.

Their focus, accuracy, and organisation keep workflow moving from barcode to bag.

At Titan PMR, we're proud to support and promote the role of Pharmacy Technicians.

With Titan's workflow, technicians can confidently run the dispensary once the pharmacist has completed clinical checks.

Today, we celebrate their expertise and the technology that helps it thrive.
