  "notes": "Organic post. Product demonstration through real pharmacy team members effectively communicated workflow features and automation benefits. Good engagement (7.8% engagement rate, 5.8% CTR) and strong watch time (18 seconds average) indicate strong audience interest in product demonstration content. Discussion prompt didn't generate comments despite good engagement."
