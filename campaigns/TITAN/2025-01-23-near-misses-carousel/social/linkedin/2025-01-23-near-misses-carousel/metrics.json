  "notes": "Organic post. Exceptional performance: 24.4% engagement rate, 22.9% CTR. This carousel leaned heavily on quantified safety proof (500 near misses prevented daily), which is consistently high-performing and trust-building for pharmacists. The stat-driven angle and clear CTA likely drove the exceptional click-through rate."
