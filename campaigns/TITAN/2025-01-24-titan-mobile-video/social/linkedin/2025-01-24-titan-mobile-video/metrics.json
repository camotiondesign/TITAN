  "notes": "Organic post. Strong product demonstration through motion graphics conveyed capability without needing on-camera testimonial. Mobile workflow resonates with remote working pharmacists and owners scaling services. Good engagement (6.1% engagement rate, 4.9% CTR) and strong watch time (18 seconds average) indicate strong audience interest. Positive feedback from ClinicRx praising platform as 'work of art' validates product quality."
