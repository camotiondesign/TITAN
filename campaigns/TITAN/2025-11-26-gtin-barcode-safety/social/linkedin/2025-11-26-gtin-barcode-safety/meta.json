Right box: labelled Cetirizine 10mg. Both boxes display identical barcodes, each highlighted by a faint circular outline. The point: two completely different medicines sharing the same GTIN barcode, creating a clear patient-safety risk. TITAN logo bottom-left. Hashtag #EveryPackCounts bottom-right.",
