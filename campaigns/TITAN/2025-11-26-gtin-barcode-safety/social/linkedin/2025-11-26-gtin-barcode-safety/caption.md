Can you spot the difference?

The GTIN doesn't.

Right now in UK pharmacy, different medicines are arriving with the same GTIN barcode or a GTIN that does not match the product inside.

When that happens, the scanner passes the wrong medicine as correct. Every safety layer collapses.

Pharmacists are forced to slow down, override the check, and carry the risk that should sit with manufacturers and regulators.

This is not a workflow problem. It is a patient safety problem.

The fix is simple:
• Make accurate GTIN barcodes mandatory
• Treat incorrect GTINs as labelling errors
• Protect the final safety check that keeps patients safe

If you work in pharmacy, please add your name.
This is a small action that protects every dispenser in the country.
