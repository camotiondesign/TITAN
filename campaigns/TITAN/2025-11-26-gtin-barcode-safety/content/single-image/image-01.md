**Alt Text:**  
Two medicine boxes are shown side by side against a soft blue gradient background.  
Above them: **"Spot the difference. The GTIN doesn't."**

- Left box: labelled *Amoxicillin 500mg*  
- Right box: labelled *Cetirizine 10mg*  

Both boxes display **identical barcodes**, each highlighted by a faint circular outline.  
The point: two completely different medicines sharing the same GTIN barcode, creating a clear patient-safety risk.
