Agreed, a sustainable model for modern community pharmacy practice cannot wait for the outcomes of contractual negotiations, it must create its own business plan. This must start with individual leadership to create the right climate, culture, behaviours, skill-mix, technologies, services (NHS and private), supported self-care, and local collaboration aligned to the NHS plan.
