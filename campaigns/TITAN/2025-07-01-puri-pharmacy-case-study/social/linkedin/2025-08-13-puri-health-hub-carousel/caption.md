While Rahul's pharmacy ran on paper and post-its.

The health hub vision was on hold.

Every day was busy but without structure.

Prescriptions were hard to track.

Services were squeezed.

The bench ruled everything.

Fast forward to today.

Rahul is running 18,000 items a month across two branches without chaos.

📦 Repeat flow reorders all MDS patients with one click.

🤖 Titan AI screens prescriptions and clears around 70% automatically.

📲 Automated texts tell patients their meds are ready.

⏱ 20 pharmacist hours a week saved.

Those hours now go into Pharmacy First, weight loss and medical cannabis clinics.

In his own words:

"𝘐 𝘢𝘮 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘨𝘭𝘶𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘩. 𝘞𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘢 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘮𝘶𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘵𝘩 𝘩𝘶𝘣."

Rahul's story is not just about efficiency.

It is about creating the headroom to lead clinically, commercially and creatively.
