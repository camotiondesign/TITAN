## Transcript

**Tariq Muhammad (0:00)**  
Those of you who remember pharmacy, and are old enough to go back as long as I have, I think you'll remember that pharmacy has changed incredibly. There was a time where actually opening a pharmacy business was simple, straightforward. All you had to do was open a pharmacy near a doctor's surgery, get an NHS contract and — Bob's your uncle — prescriptions would start flowing in. It was easy.

But what that did was create complacency. We became dependent on the NHS. Based on that, we relaxed. We didn't really focus on our image and our future. We just made hay while the sun shined. It created an image of us as a profession, and that image led to the established behaviours of the people in power and what they did to pharmacy thereafter — MPs, civil servants, the government, the bodies that negotiate with us. They effectively started working in a way to erode the dispensing model that we had.

We had an erosion of the dispensing fee and the income we had, whilst we had this dangling carrot of services and other things that we could get — but it was always a bridge too far. That's gone on and on for many years, and today most of us running a pharmacy know dispensing is not viable on its own.

But the rhetoric around services does not match the reality of implementation. We hear speeches about the value of pharmacy and how important its future is to the healthcare system. But then the implementation of the services is hard to reach, and if we are successful, there are usually cutbacks. We saw it with MURs, with NMS. We start delivering NMS and when we do too many, that's no good. We heard about Pharmacy First — £600 million going into services — and then the smoke and mirrors appear again.

We see this in technology as well. I'm the CEO of Titan. We've been trying to wait for Pharmacy First now for two years and we can't get through accreditation because the implementation does not match the rhetoric.

But — there is optimism. We now have pharmacists coming out as IPs. There is demand in the healthcare system unlike ever before. GPs cannot fulfil that demand. There is opportunity for pharmacists to step into that space and lead, but we must learn from the past.

**Advice for pharmacy owners:**

1. **Control dispensing, don't be entangled in it.** Use technology to streamline safely and efficiently so pharmacists aren't physically involved in every step.

2. **Your NHS patients are your audience.** They are your future private patients.

3. **Fix the image problem.** Our past image shaped our current reality — don't repeat that mistake.

4. **Create a new offer.** We don't need to replicate GPs — give patients choice.

5. **Earn the trust.** Regulations are not tick boxes — quality matters.

6. **We must be efficient.** Nail service delivery with slick operations and tech enabling the journey.

This year we've launched Titanverse with purpose — a complete solution only for pharmacy. AI scribes for consultations. Prescribing that flows straight back to Titan. CRM to target patients. Compliance and training. Workflow, bookings, payments, integrations — all efficient and affordable.

This talk is about setting the destination, learning from the past, creating a future we can be proud of — viable, profitable, sustainable and independent, not dependent on the NHS. If I had a strapline for pharmacy: **more dentist.**

Thank you.
