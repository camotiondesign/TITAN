## Transcript

**User:**  
Biggest loss may made is that 70,000 about two years ago, and we knew we had to make some changes. We're a busy pharmacy, 30,000 items a month, and I knew that time would would essentially make a big difference. So we we used to have 28 staff, and with with making time and introducing time. We've now got 19 staff doing the same number of items, so increased capacity massively more efficient. Yeah, and we're now making a good profit as well. That was thanks to that, as we know, staffing levels are probably, yeah, biggest portion of costs.

**Hooman:**  
Congratulations on the change. Yeah, and aiding private services as well.

**User:**  
Yes, the other factor that's made a big difference, we've got three consultation rooms, yeah. And thanks to the freeing up of the time, the pharmacist, because it's so much more efficient in terms of the clinic lane, they're able now to do more travel services, avpns, vaccines, injections, and we're doing also IP Pathfinder now in our pharmacy. And obviously pharmacy first as well. So we're, they're freed up to do those things now.

**Hooman:**  
And you've seen Titan this, what? What do you think your Titan does?

**User:**  
Yeah, very, very impressive. I think this idea of being able to automatically transcript a conversation that would then go straight into the notes, yeah, is potentially a game changer, because, again, we're wanting to do more services reduce the time that's needed to make those notes yeah and time versus does that your other factor for us would be the booking system. It seems to be very, very effective. They embedded into our website. There'll be more efficient as well. So we're really excited about that.

**Hooman:**  
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

**User:**
