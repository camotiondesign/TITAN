## Transcript

**Interviewer:**  
So we're here with Prab, who was our second Titan customer ever. What an honor. So we're going to be asking you a few questions today. Lovely to meet you.

**Prab:**  
Nice to see you. Nice to see you again.

**Interviewer:**  
So what first made you switch to Titan?

**Prab:**  
I'd obviously worked with the Titan team before on their previous products, but I was really looking for a new way of working in my pharmacy, something that would allow me to scale, and I felt my previous PMR was not allowing me to do that. I really loved the scanning function, the safety that it brought. I totally eradicated the look alike, sound alike errors that occur traditionally in pharmacy. And I've just been on the journey ever since really and I've been really enjoying it.

**Interviewer:**  
Do you feel that there's been a big change in your workflow since you've implemented Titan?

**Prab:**  
Huge fundamental shift. I'm no longer chained to the dispensing bench. I'm able to actually think about my business in a way that I would not have been able to previously. I'm beta testing Titanverse, which has been fantastic, really enjoying that, and it's made a huge difference to my consultations. I'm now seeing more patients than ever before, and it's really nice. I'm able to have a bit more rapport with them because we're using ambient voice technology, so the transcriptions are happening live and my customers absolutely love it. It's allowed me to diversify what I'm doing and actually enjoy being in pharmacy now. If I'd carried on in the traditional way, chained to my dispensing bench, signing off labels, I think I would have left community pharmacy by now.

**Interviewer:**  
Able to exercise your clinical skills a lot more?

**Prab:**  
Yeah, it's allowed me to work to the top of my degree. I didn't become a pharmacist to be signing off labels. I'm so much more clinical than I was before, and that's thanks to my system freeing me up. We use every single module that Titan has. I really love the new version of the AI — it's clearing 70 to 80 percent of my prescriptions and I can just get on with my day. I'm in my consultation room, seeing patients, doing the bits I actually enjoy.

**Interviewer:**  
What would you say your favourite feature of Titan is?

**Prab:**  
Batch flow. I was lucky to be one of the early testers. We also have a Meditech robot using single basket mode — it's made a huge fundamental difference. We finish efficiently, the day completes cleanly, and I can rest easy. We have a fully automated pharmacy over here.

**Interviewer:**  
And lastly, if you could describe Titan in one word, what would that be?

**Prab:**  
Revolutionary.

**Interviewer:**  
Revolutionary? Thank you so much.

**Prab:**  
Thank you.

**Interviewer:**  
Thank you.

**Prab:**  
Thank you very much. You.
