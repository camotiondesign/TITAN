## Transcript

**Interviewer:**  
So we're here with Zainab from Pill Sorted.

**Zainab:**  
Hi, I'm Zainab. I'm the Superintendent Pharmacist of Pill Sorted. And just like Titan, we understand the importance of barcodes in all of the dispensing process — especially the patient safety part. As a pharmacist who's worked 20 years, if there's any changes to a box of a medicine, that box can be recalled by the MHRA — and that's any change other than the barcode. But barcodes are becoming more and more important in the whole process, so any error in that can cause significant risk to the patients. That's what we're very passionate about. We have created a petition — I'd appreciate everybody to read and share and sign it so that we could create that barcode to be part of the application form that the manufacturers send for the MHRA so it becomes a mandatory part of the application.

**Interviewer:**  
Very good point. And obviously at Titan, we understand the importance of barcode accuracy. So Zainab, what's your opinion on Pill Sorted collaboration?

**Zainab:**  
So I've done an article in the C&D exactly about this part, because I view Titan as one of the biggest pioneers of doing pharmacy in a different way — especially barcode. And now more and more patients are understanding the importance of the barcodes as well. Let me give you an example: If a barcode on a medicine of Visor Prolog 2.5 (which is a hard medicine) gets used again on another medicine of Biosolue 10 milligram, that could cause significant danger to that patient. Titan being a pioneer, Pill Sorted being a pioneer, we can capture those errors before it reaches the patient. And we are doing important work with the NHSD and MHRA to implement this at the source — the application form that manufacturers send to the MHRA.

**Interviewer:**  
So we have two software teams ensuring barcode accuracy and patient safety. Zainab, thank you very much for your time.

**Zainab:**  
Thank you.
