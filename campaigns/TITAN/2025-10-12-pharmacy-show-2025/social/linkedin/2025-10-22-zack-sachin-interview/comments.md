Thank you Sachin Badiani for articulating the reasons why pharmacists are switching to TITAN PMR. Barcode validation ensures safety, workflow maximises skill mix and efficiencies in the pharmacy. Then there are features which we categorise as "quality of life" like ordering. Finally there is TITANVERSE which enables efficient provision of pharmacy services.
