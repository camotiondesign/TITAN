What. A. Day. 🎉

Absolute madness at The Pharmacy Show today. Sore throats, sore legs, but completely worth it.

The Titan stand was packed from morning until close.

Huge thanks to everyone who came to see Titan and TITANVERSE in action. You made day one unforgettable. 💙

And a big thank you to The Pharmacy Show team for bringing the profession together once again.
