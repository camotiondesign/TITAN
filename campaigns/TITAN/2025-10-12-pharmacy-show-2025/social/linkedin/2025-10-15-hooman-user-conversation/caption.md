Real conversations. Real impact.

At The Pharmacy Show, Hooman caught up with an existing Titan user to hear how Titan has transformed their pharmacy — from workflow efficiency to service delivery.

🗣️ "We've gone from 28 staff to 19 staff doing the same 30,000 items a month."

💬 "Thanks to freeing up pharmacist time, we're now doing more travel services, vaccines, injections, and IP Pathfinder."

✨ "Titanverse's automatic transcription is potentially a game changer for reducing note-taking time."

This is what happens when pharmacy gets the right tools.
