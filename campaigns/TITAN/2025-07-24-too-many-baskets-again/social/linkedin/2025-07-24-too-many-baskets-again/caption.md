From overflowing baskets

To calm, scalable pharmacy in weeks

This is what happens when a system finally helps carry the weight.

Pharmacies aren't failing to grow.
They're trying to scale on tools that weren't built for it.

Every extra item means extra effort
unless your PMR is built to handle more.

At Titan, we've seen the same story across the UK: bit.ly/3GPxjnN 

• Teams stretched too thin
• Baskets stacking up
• Owners forced to hire just to keep up

Then they switch to Titan:

• AI clears up to 90% of scripts
• Pharmacists step off the bench
• Dispensers run workflow with confidence
• Volumes rise
• Stress falls

This is what happens when your team gets backup. Not burnout.
