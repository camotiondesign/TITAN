Pharmacies are shouldering the weight of NHS demands.

Here's how they're thriving under the pressure.

Pharmacies in the UK are stepping up as GPs face increasing demand. The upside? Every consultation brings extra NHS income for your pharmacy.

But here's the challenge:

Most pharmacy teams are stretched thin managing dispensing and day-to-day operations. To qualify for Pharmacy First consultation payments, you need to handle at least 25 consultations a month.

That's where automation and AI make the difference. Tools like Titan streamline workflows, automate admin tasks, and free up your team to focus on patients.

The results:

• More consultations, more revenue.  

• Faster, smarter patient care.  

• A future-ready pharmacy that thrives under pressure.  

With the right systems, you can meet rising demand, grow private services, and keep your pharmacy running smoothly.

How has your pharmacy handled the shift? Let's discuss in the comments.
