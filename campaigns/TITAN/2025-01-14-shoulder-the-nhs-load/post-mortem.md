## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Strong macro narrative tied to policy:** Successfully connected NHS pressure to pharmacy operational needs
- **Clear articulation of problem → consequence → opportunity:** Narrative structure effectively communicated the challenge and solution
- **Positioned Titan as required infrastructure, not optional tool:** Messaging positioned automation as essential, not nice-to-have
- **NHS-aligned context:** Content demonstrated appetite for policy-aware, NHS-focused messaging

### What Didn't Work

- **No comments — discussion invite missed:** Despite asking "How has your pharmacy handled the shift? Let's discuss in the comments," no comments were generated
- **Could include clearer revenue example (£ calculation):** Missing specific revenue calculations or examples
- **Awareness-level post, lacked tactical next step:** Content built awareness but didn't provide clear tactical guidance

### Audience Insights

- **Policy-aware audience:** Strong engagement for NHS policy content indicates audience interest in strategic context
- **Awareness over action:** High impressions but no comments suggests awareness-level consumption without discussion
- **NHS strategy alignment:** Content successfully resonated with NHS strategy followers and policy-aware operators
