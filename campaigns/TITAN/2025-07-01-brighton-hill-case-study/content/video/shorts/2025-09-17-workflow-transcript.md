Titan has changed the whole pharmacy workflow. For me, Titan has played a big role in time leverage to run other services at the pharmacy. The percentage of my time goes into the services in the morning. First thing when I walk in, I do the clinical checks. By around 10 or 11, I can then run the services without interrupting my dispensing flow.

We're using repeat flow to order prescriptions for some of our Nomad patients. Titan Mobile helps us quickly find a patient at the counter and send them a text as well.

Batch Flow is another big one. It really helps streamline the dispensing process, where we can do single patient mode or multi-patient mode — two different modes that help my team dispense efficiently.

Titan has changed the whole pharmacy workflow for me. I would not consider any other PMR. It has significantly helped run the pharmacy smoothly.
