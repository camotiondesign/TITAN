# How Brighton Hill Pharmacy Scaled from 4K to 17K Without the Stress

Brighton Hill Pharmacy in Basingstoke is a fast-growing, service-led pharmacy run by owner and pharmacist Sagar Lungiwala. He took over the site, formerly operated by Boots, in 2020, starting with just 4,000 items a month. Since then, he has scaled to over 17,000 items, built a loyal patient base, and put clinical services at the heart of the operation. Brighton Hill was also the first pharmacy in the UK to integrate Titan PMR with a Meditech robot, combining high-volume efficiency with a calm, patient-first experience.

## The Challenge

Sagar didn't inherit a busy pharmacy. He took over a former Boots branch, starting with just 4,000 items a month, and set out to build something much bigger. His goal was to grow rapidly, deliver high-quality services, and maintain a calm and efficient experience for both patients and staff.

But most pharmacy systems weren't built for that kind of model. They relied on paper, slowed everything down, and kept pharmacists stuck in the dispensary. If Sagar wanted to scale safely, he needed the right foundation from day one.

## How They Did It

### 1. Started with Titan, Built Around It

From day one, Sagar designed the pharmacy with Titan in mind. No paper, no legacy systems, no compromises. The goal was to create a setup that could scale without needing constant firefighting.

> "Since the beginning of owning the pharmacy, from day one, I had no doubt about it. Titan was the PMR which I had to go for."

> "There was nothing out there like Titan PMR at the time. It's a paperless system and it saves time, which is the main thing."

That setup laid the foundation for serious growth.

> "So we started with 4,000 items, and in just about around four years now, we're doing around 17,000 items."

### 2. Built the Day Around Clinical Automation

Every morning starts with Titan AI. Clinical checks are run first thing, freeing Sagar to focus on services for the rest of the day without interruptions or bottlenecks.

> "I do the clinical checks… probably around 10 or 11, I can then run the services without interrupting my dispensing flow."

He doesn't use an ACT or ACD, and still only spends a short window each day in the dispensary. Everything else is delegated.

> "The rest of my time goes into the services, which is like 80% of my time."

That structure helps the team stay consistently ahead of the workload.

> "We always try to complete whatever the GP surgeries send us on the same day. That makes it really easy to serve patients efficiently."

---

### 3. Streamlined the Workflow with Batch and Mobile

With Batch Flow, Titan Mobile, and whole team visibility, the pharmacy runs smoothly even during peak times. Staff are aware of the location and current status of every prescription. No guessing. No delays.

> "Even in a busy hour of the pharmacy, I'm sure my team is all calm and collected. We serve one patient at a time."

> "My team can exactly track the prescription… If it's ready, Titan Mobile will highlight that it's already on the shelf, let's say A1 for example."

Batch Flow provides them with the flexibility to run either multi-patient or single-patient workflows, depending on the day's demands.

> "It does save significant time."

### 4. Prioritised Services Over Volume

From the start, the business model was built around services, not just dispensing. Sagar redesigned the space, incorporating two consultation rooms, and now offers a wide range of NHS and private clinics.

> "Alongside dispensing, my core model of the pharmacy is the services. That's the future."

> "We offer private travel clinic, ear suction removal, blood pressure monitoring, contraception, and a weight loss clinic."

> "Titan has played a big role in terms of giving me the time leverage, which we all want in today's world."

---

### 5. Pioneered the Titan–Meditech Integration

Brighton Hill became the first pharmacy in the UK to integrate Titan PMR with a Meditech robot. The setup was smooth, and the impact was immediate.

> "I was the first Titan Meditech robot installation. In my opinion, it went perfectly smooth."

> "We were able to dispense the prescription from Titan and Meditech integration… we have increased our efficiency significantly."

> "It has streamlined the process for my dispensing team."

## The Results

In just four years, Brighton Hill Pharmacy has grown from 4,000 to over 17,000 items a month. But volume alone isn't the headline. What stands out is how calm, controlled, and service-led that growth has been.

- Volume scaled 4x without chaos  

- 80% of Sagar's time now goes to clinical services  

- Full Titan ecosystem in place: AI, Batch Flow, Mobile, Repeat  

- First UK pharmacy to integrate Titan PMR with the Meditech robot  

- Same-day dispensing as standard  

- More revenue through private clinics and NHS services  

- Paperless, transparent, efficient  

> "Titan has overall changed the whole pharmacy workflow for me, in a nutshell, because it is an integral part of how we operate."

> "All my team members get praises throughout the day. And it's just the whole process. The whole thing is because we try to help patients."

## The Takeaway

Brighton Hill Pharmacy wasn't scaled by chance. Sagar built it with purpose — designing the space, workflow, and tech stack to support a high-volume, high-service model that doesn't burn anyone out.

> "Titan PMR will be the one to go for, for my expanding pharmacies as well."

> "It's very easy to learn. From day one, everybody was comfortable dispensing. It just flows."
