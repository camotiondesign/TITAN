Meet Sagar, bit of a tech guy, and the owner of Brighton Hill Pharmacy in Basingstoke, where things run smoothly and never get chaotic.

**Speaker 2 — 0:08**  
So I'm Sagar Lungiwala. I'm the owner of Brighton Hill Pharmacy. This used to be ex-Boots.  
Been four years now owning this pharmacy, and I've significantly grown from 4,000 items when I started to around 17,000–18,000 items now, which is a fourfold increase in terms of items.
