✍️ In most PMRs, safety depends on signatures and memory. 

In Titan, it's automatic.

Every script has a full digital audit trail:

✅ Who clinically checked it

✅ When it was labelled

✅ When it was handed out

✅ Who handed it out

No guesswork. No missing scripts. No "did we give that out?" moments.

For teams, it means less stress and fewer mistakes.

For pharmacists, it means freedom to focus on services.

For patients, it means faster, safer handouts.

That's what pharmacy should feel like. Calm. Clear. Accountable.
