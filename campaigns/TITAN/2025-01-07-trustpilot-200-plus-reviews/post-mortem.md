## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Strong credibility hook:** "200+ 5-star reviews" messaging effectively reduced risk perception
- **Branded motion asset stands out in feed:** Animated format differentiated from static content
- **Organic engagement and CTR healthy:** 7.3% engagement rate and 5.2% CTR indicate strong organic performance
- **Social proof value:** Trustpilot milestone provided independently verified credibility

### What Didn't Work

- **Paid impressions didn't convert to clicks:** 1,689 sponsored impressions generated 0 clicks
- **Messaging leaned awareness not acquisition:** Content built brand awareness but didn't drive action from cold audience
- **No engagement from sponsored traffic:** 0 engagements from 1,689 sponsored impressions

### Audience Insights

- **Organic audience primed:** Existing followers/connections engaged well (7.3% engagement rate)
- **Sponsored audience cold, not primed:** Cold audience didn't engage despite high impression volume
- **Branding vs conversion:** Sponsored content served branding purpose but didn't drive conversions
- **No pain point framing:** Messaging lacked problem/solution structure for cold audience

---

## Recommendations

### For Future Similar Campaigns

- **Variant: "Thinking of switching PMR? Here's what pharmacies say":** Add problem framing to engage cold audience
- **Add micro-quotes on-screen:** Include specific review quotes in video for more concrete social proof
- **Introduce before/after stats with Trustpilot proof:** Combine social proof with transformation narrative
- **Target warm audiences for sponsored:** Use sponsored budget for retargeting engaged users rather than cold prospecting

### Content Adjustments

- **Keep:** Credibility hook, animated format, Trustpilot milestone, organic messaging
- **Add:** Problem framing, specific quotes, transformation narrative, retargeting strategy
- **Test:** Variants with pain points, micro-quotes, before/after stats, warm audience targeting

### Process Improvements

- **Reusable proof-point template:** Create template for updating milestone numbers as they increase
- **Variant development:** Build variants for NHS reviews, service metrics, user growth
- **Sponsored strategy:** Develop separate messaging for cold vs warm audiences
- **Conversion tracking:** Better track sponsored impact on brand awareness vs direct conversions

---

## Next Steps

- Update number as milestone increases (e.g., 250+, 300+)
- Build variants (NHS reviews, service metrics, user growth)
- Create "Thinking of switching PMR?" variant with problem framing
- Test micro-quotes and before/after stats format
- Develop retargeting strategy for sponsored content

## Campaign Context

**Key Insight:**
High visibility with sponsored amplification. Organic engagement positive; sponsored results show branding impact rather than CTA conversion.

**Significance:**
This campaign successfully leveraged Trustpilot milestone as a credibility asset, demonstrating strong organic performance but highlighting the need for different messaging strategies for cold vs warm audiences. The campaign establishes a reusable proof-point template that can be updated as milestones increase.
