# Trustpilot — 200+ 5-Star Reviews

This campaign leverages Titan's Trustpilot milestone as a credibility asset to reduce risk perception and support conversion consideration. Animated branded ad format, boosted after organic performance.

## Primary Asset

- Short-form animated ad with VO

## Supporting Assets

- LinkedIn post (boosted Jan 15–17)

## Outcome

High visibility with sponsored amplification. Organic engagement positive; sponsored results show branding impact rather than CTA conversion.

## Strategic Note

This becomes a reusable proof-point; update number as milestone increases and build variants (e.g., NHS reviews, service metrics, user growth).
