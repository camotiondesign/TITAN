Some PMRs still brag about printing prescriptions automatically.

That's like celebrating fax machines in 2025.

Pharmacy has evolved. Legacy PMRs haven't.

Still dealing with:

• Stacks of printed tokens flying everywhere.

• Manual checks slowing down every step.

• No real tracking—just chaos.

This isn't about a minor update.

It's about taking control with a fully digital approach.
