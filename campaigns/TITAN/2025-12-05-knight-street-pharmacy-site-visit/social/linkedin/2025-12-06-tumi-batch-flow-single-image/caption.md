This is Tumi.

A dispenser at Knight street Pharmacy ⭐

It was her first weekend using Titan.
She moved from doing one patient at a time to processing groups of twenty using batch flow.

When asked how she found it, she said it was:
"Very easy."
"It's quick."
And she could "see the potential in it." 💬

Many pharmacy owners worry about how fast their teams will adapt to a new PMR.
Tumi shows how quickly staff can pick up Titan and keep the work moving.
