**Speaker 1 (Nas):**  
Which number pharmacy is this now? Because I lost count.

**Speaker 2 (Yusuf):**  
This is number 11.

**Speaker 1 (Nas):**  
How was your implementation today?

**Speaker 2 (Yusuf):**  
Really good. Really good. We decided this time we were going to do it on a quiet day, Thomas, Saturday today, giving the staff as much time behind closed doors to be able to understand time on it without the phones ringing, without patients walking through the door.  
Went head on with batch flow, making sure that they understood the process. Set up the entire dispensary for that. And it's been quicker because of it.

In terms of workflow, we've been able to tailor the workflow for it. Got people picking specifically to the pick sheet. People just there, standing there, getting the dispensing done. And that way we're getting more in a short period of time.  
We're doing batches of 20s. We've done quite a few now, separating collections and deliveries. So workflow is quite orderly and well organised.

Making sure your equipment is working beforehand, calibrated and everything can communicate, really, to a buster. That's key.

Good day so far. Really good day.

Good help from you or the staff — definitely asked you lots of questions to make sure that anything that they needed to know, you answered.
