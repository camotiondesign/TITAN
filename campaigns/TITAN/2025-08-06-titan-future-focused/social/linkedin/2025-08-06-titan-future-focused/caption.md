Most PMRs were built for paperwork.

Titan was built for the future.

The NHS isn't experimenting with AI.

They're embedding it — into prescribing, patient safety, and clinical workflow.

And Titan? Already there.

✅ AI checks built-in, not bolted on
✅ Designed for clinical time, not screen time
✅ Live across hundreds of UK sites
✅ ISO 27001 certified and NHS-accredited

This isn't just software.

It's intelligent infrastructure for a new era of pharmacy.
