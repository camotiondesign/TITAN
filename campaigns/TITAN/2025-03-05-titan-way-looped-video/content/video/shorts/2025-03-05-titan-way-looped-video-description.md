## Video Description

A looped video designed to feel like you're looking through a single, blinking eye. The eyelid opens and closes rhythmically, and through the pupil you can see Titan's Kanban board in motion. The interface is instantly recognisable as Titan, using its black background and brand colours throughout. The effect is minimal and slightly unsettling, drawing attention to the workflow inside the system rather than the system itself.
