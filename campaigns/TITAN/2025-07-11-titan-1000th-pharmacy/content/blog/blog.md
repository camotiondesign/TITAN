# From Vision to 1000 Pharmacies: The Transformative Journey of Titan PMR

**Date:** July 14, 2025  

In July 2025, we hit a milestone: our 1000th pharmacy went live on Titan.

We marked the moment with confetti, cake, and a lot of gratitude.

Looking back, it made us reflect on where this all started. And why we built Titan in the first place.

## It started with frustration  
A system that didn't work.  
A business held hostage by clunky software.  
And a pharmacist who decided that enough was enough.

### A System Born in the Dispensary, Not the Boardroom

Titan PMR launched as a concept at the Pharmacy Show.  
Built by pharmacists, for pharmacists.  
Designed to remove friction, automate intelligently,  
and release the pharmacist from the checking bench.

Fast-forward to 2025. Titan now processes over twelve percent  
of the UK's prescription volume.

## The 1000th Pharmacy: More Than a Number

May + Thomson Pharmacy in Woking — a site rebuilt for the future.

Confetti, cake, and conversation — but more importantly: belief.

A belief that pharmacies can be better.

## A Product of Vision, Dedication, and Teamwork

Titan was shaped by a small team driven by one idea:  
Pharmacy deserves better.

**Wahid Muhammad** — CTO  
**Jeff Shelley** — CIO  
**Hooman Ghalamkari** — COO  
**Sajid Ramzan** — Chief Sales Officer  

## Built to Interoperate, Not Isolate

Titan is the digital backbone — mobile, automated, connected.

## What's Next?

Private services. Remote models. Titanverse.

## 1000 Pharmacies. And Still Building.

Titan didn't start with a pitch deck.  
It started with a pharmacist and a problem.

Here's to the next 1000.  
We're just getting started.
