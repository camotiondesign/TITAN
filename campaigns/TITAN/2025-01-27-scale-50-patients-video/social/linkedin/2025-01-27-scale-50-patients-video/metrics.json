  "notes": "Organic post. Strong scaling message ('50 patients at a time') and efficiency gains resonated with audience. Good engagement (8.5% engagement rate, 7.4% CTR) and strong watch time (15 seconds average) indicate strong audience interest in scaling solutions. The message about scaling without increasing man hours addressed a core concern for pharmacy owners."
