BMP Healthcare is a growing independent group with twelve branches across the Midlands, 150 staff, and 170,000 items dispensed each month. Despite success, legacy systems kept pharmacists tied to the bench and services limited.

In 2023, BMP adopted Titan PMR and later Titanverse, transforming how it dispenses and delivers care.

## At a Glance

- **70 percent reduction** in clinical checking  

- **2× faster** dispensing speed  

- **500 percent increase** in clinical services

## The Challenge: Scaling Without Burnout

BMP started in 2017 and grew fast, but the systems stayed manual.

> "Even with ProScript I still had a mountain to check as a pharmacist."

Each new branch meant more pressure and risk. The aim was simple: make dispensing faster, safer, and fully traceable without extra stress or staff.

---

## How They Did It

At The Pharmacy Show 2023, Yusuf saw Titan for the first time.

> "Titan were the only ones who actually knew pharmacy was changing and showing us stuff that we knew we needed to be a part of. We knew that was the way we needed to go, and we knew Titan was going to be that platform."

BMP started with one pilot site. Within six months, they were adding a new branch every month.

### Titan AI: Reducing Pharmacist Load by 70 Percent

By delegating routine checks to Titan's AI, pharmacists now verify only 20 to 30 percent of prescriptions.

> "In any of our branches now with Titan, a pharmacist who isn't working with an ACT or a checking dispenser, your checking is down to probably between 20 and 30 percent. That's a massive change in time needed to be in the dispensary."

> "Now you'll find that the pharmacist is planted inside their consultation room, and that's where they should be. Titan has allowed us to do that."

The impact was immediate. Pharmacists who once spent full days checking prescriptions could now focus entirely on patients, services, and clinical leadership.

### Barcode Scanning: Eliminating Human Error

Titan's barcode scanning made the entire assembly process auditable and error-free.

> "The barcode scanning is massive. Knowing that no matter who has assembled it, as long as they follow the process one label at a time, one box at a time, you've completely eliminated the ability to make that error."

> "It's auditable. You can see the time, the batch number, the expiry date, everything that's been scanned. If there's ever a problem, it's all traceable down to the person."

Every item is now tracked from label to bag. Accuracy is no longer assumed; it's proven.

---

### Batch Flow: Doubling Dispensing Speed

Batch Flow allows BMP's teams to safely process multiple prescriptions at once without losing focus.

> "Batch Flow has been incredible in terms of being able to process multiple prescriptions in one go. As long as the process is followed as it should be, it can probably double the speed of normal dispensing."

Even with interruptions such as patient questions, phone calls, and deliveries, the system picks up exactly where it left off. Efficiency no longer means compromise.

---

### A Workflow You Can Hear

> "If you were to walk into our pharmacy at a busy hour, you'd probably feel like you walked into the checkout at Tesco, because all you're hearing is beeping. That's what I want to hear. It means everyone's following the process, no overrides, everyone scanning the boxes, everyone scanning the labels."

That sound of constant scanning and calm repetition is the sound of pharmacy re-engineered for safety and control.

## Unlocking Clinical Growth with Titanverse

Once dispensing was perfected, BMP turned its focus to services. As early adopters of Titanverse, they used the platform to centralise NMS and scale AI-guided consultations.

> "We've been one of the early adopters of Titanverse. As soon as we saw it at the Pharmacy Show 2023, I made it quite clear I wanted to be one of the first ones to use it."

The first live module was NMS, allowing one pharmacist to manage services across multiple branches from a single dashboard.

> "Normally your pharmacist on site would be completing this, or you'd have to hire extra pharmacists. By allowing us to do it all from a central location, we were able to make it more efficient."

---

### AI-Guided Consultations

Titanverse's AI templates now power consultations for Pharmacy First, travel health, and weight management.

> "The AI is literally the greatest thing I've ever seen. I can create templates for travel vaccination, weight loss, or Pharmacy First, tailor each consultation without making the patient wait."

Every session is automatically transcribed and summarised, capturing every question, vital sign, and outcome.

> "It's so thorough that sometimes it asks questions I wouldn't have thought of asking myself."

Pharmacists can now spend more time with the patient instead of typing notes afterwards.

> "I'm sitting facing the patient, having a conversation. Because Titanverse picks it all up, I don't need to type afterwards. It's a more human experience for the patient."

---

### Investing in Staff, Not Cutting Back

The efficiency gains didn't lead to job cuts; they led to upskilling.

> "If we can give our staff more time rather than making cuts, we will. Titan has allowed us to do that."

Dispensers are being trained for vaccinations, technicians are taking on clinical support roles, and pharmacists are prescribing and leading services.

## The Results

| Outcome | Impact |

|--------|--------|

| Pharmacist checks | Reduced to 20–30 percent |

| Dispensing speed | Doubled using Batch Flow |

| Clinical services | Increased by up to 500 percent |

| Human error | Eliminated through barcode scanning |

| Items per month | 170,000 across 12 sites |

| Team model | Staff retrained, not reduced |

> "We're not chasing items anymore. We're about service. That's what pharmacies should be, and Titan allows us to do that."

## The Takeaway

BMP Healthcare shows what happens when pharmacy design meets intelligent infrastructure.

Titan PMR freed pharmacists from the bench — cutting checks, doubling speed, and building calm into every workflow.

Titanverse turned that freedom into clinical growth — scaling AI-guided services and human-first care.

Together, they've built a modern, service-led model of pharmacy that scales without chaos.
