# BNF Integration Campaign: Strategic Guide

This document provides strategic guidance for the BNF integration campaign, including guardrails, language guidelines, and activation phases.

---

## Campaign Approach

**Strategy: Proof-First Activation with Minimal Press**

This is not an announcement campaign. This is an infrastructure upgrade that should be proven before it's promoted.

### Why This Approach

- **BNF credibility is earned, not announced.** Pharmacists trust BNF because it's reliable, not because of press releases. Titan should demonstrate the same restraint.
- **Past performance shows NHS-aligned, proof-driven content reaches the widest audience.** The NHS Independent Prescribing campaign achieved 5,655 impressions (highest reach) by focusing on practical impact, not partnership hype.
- **Clinical trust is built through specificity.** The "500 near misses prevented daily" campaign reached 1,504 impressions and worked because it quantified safety. BNF integration should follow the same pattern: show what changes, not that a partnership exists.
- **Titan's tone is calm confidence, not promotional.** Tariq's Pharmacy Show transcript demonstrates infrastructure thinking: "technology is the vehicle, not the destination." BNF is infrastructure, not marketing.

## Language Guardrails

### Forbidden Phrases

- "Game-changing partnership"
- "Revolutionary integration"
- "Industry-leading collaboration"
- "BNF and Titan together" (partner-centric)
- "We're excited to announce..." (too promotional)
- "This changes everything" (over-promising)

**Why:**
- These phrases shift focus from infrastructure to marketing
- They create expectations that can't be met
- They don't match Titan's tone (calm confidence, not hype)

### Claims That Must Be Precise

**Titan PMR:**
- ✅ "BNF guidance surfaces in clinical checks and dispensing safety workflows"
- ❌ "BNF checks everything automatically" (implies replacement of pharmacist)
- ✅ "BNF data is embedded in clinical decision support"
- ❌ "BNF guarantees safety" (over-promising)

**Titanverse:**
- ✅ "BNF and BNF for Children data powers decision support for services and prescribing"
- ❌ "BNF runs your consultations" (too abstract, implies replacement)
- ✅ "Service templates reference BNF guidance"
- ❌ "BNF does your prescribing" (clinically dangerous framing)

**General:**
- ✅ "BNF is the source you trust for professional practice"
- ❌ "BNF endorses Titan" (BNF doesn't endorse products)
- ✅ "BNF data is now part of Titan's clinical infrastructure"
- ❌ "Titan is now BNF-powered" (too partner-centric, implies BNF is the hero)

## Narrative Power Dynamic

### Where Titan Must Lead

- **Explanation of integration** — How BNF appears in workflow
- **Practical impact** — What changes for pharmacists day-to-day
- **Infrastructure positioning** — BNF as part of Titan's foundation
- **Product differentiation** — How this distinguishes Titan from other PMRs

### Where BNF Can Reinforce

- **Clinical credibility** — BNF's authority as the gold standard
- **Professional trust** — BNF's role in exams and professional defence
- **Data quality** — BNF as reliable, trusted source

### Power Dynamic

- Titan explains the upgrade. BNF validates the source.
- Titan leads the narrative. BNF provides credibility.
- Avoid: "BNF and Titan announce partnership" (equal billing shifts focus)

---

## Core Message

"BNF guidance is now embedded in Titan PMR and Titanverse. Clinical checks, dispensing safety, and service decision support reference the same source you trust for professional practice."

**Why this works:**
- **Specific** — States exactly where BNF appears (clinical checks, dispensing safety, decision support)
- **Restrained** — No hype, no "game-changing" language
- **Trust-building** — References BNF as the source pharmacists already trust
- **Infrastructure framing** — Positions BNF as part of Titan's foundation, not a bolt-on feature

## Success Metrics

**Primary Metric: Impressions**

Carousel engagement rates are inflated because LinkedIn counts each slide swipe as engagement. Impressions are the true gauge of reach and audience size.

**Target: 5,000+ impressions**

Based on NHS Independent Prescribing campaign precedent (5,655 impressions).

## Partnership Activation Decision

### Decision: Proof-First Rollout with Minimal Press

**No joint press release. No day-one announcement.**

**Rationale:**
1. BNF credibility is earned through use, not promotion
2. Proof-first content reaches the widest audience (NHS Independent Prescribing: 5,655 impressions)
3. Titan's tone is infrastructure, not marketing
4. Clinical trust requires specificity, not hype
5. Partner-led narratives drift

**If BNF Requires Joint Announcement:**
- **Titan-led announcement** with BNF endorsement quote
- Titan explains the integration. BNF validates the source.
- Avoid equal billing or partner-centric framing

## What Success Looks Like

- Pharmacists understand BNF is embedded in their workflow
- Clinical trust increases through proof, not promotion
- Titan's infrastructure positioning strengthens
- No narrative drift toward partner-led messaging
