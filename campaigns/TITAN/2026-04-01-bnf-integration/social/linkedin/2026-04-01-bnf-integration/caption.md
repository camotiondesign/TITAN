## Caption Text

BNF guidance is embedded in Titan PMR and Titanverse.

Pharmacists leave their PMR to consult BNF mid-check. That interruption breaks your flow.

BNF data appears automatically in clinical checks and dispensing safety workflows. For Titanverse, BNF and BNF for Children guide service decisions and prescribing.

BNF supports your clinical judgement. It doesn't replace it.

BNF is the source you trust for professional practice, exams, and clinical defence. Having that same source where you make decisions means clinical guidance appears when you need it.

This is an infrastructure upgrade, not a partnership announcement. BNF is part of Titan's clinical foundation.
