## Full Transcript

[Opening - 10 seconds]

BNF guidance is embedded in Titan PMR and Titanverse.

[The Problem - 15 seconds]

You know what it's like. You're in the middle of a check, you need BNF, you leave the system. That interruption costs time and breaks your flow.

[The Solution - 20 seconds]

When you're checking a prescription, BNF guidance is there. When you're making a dispensing decision, it's there. You don't leave the system. For Titanverse, BNF and BNF for Children guide service decisions and prescribing.

[Why This Matters - 20 seconds]

BNF is the source you trust for professional practice, exams, and clinical defence. Having that same source where you make decisions means clinical guidance appears when you need it.

[What This Is Not - 10 seconds]

BNF supports your clinical judgement. It doesn't replace it.

[Close - 10 seconds]

The same source you trust for professional practice, exams, and clinical defence. Now it's where you make decisions.

## Tone Guidelines

- **Calm confidence** — Not excited, not promotional
- **Infrastructure language** — "Embedded," "appears," "part of the foundation"
- **Professional respect** — Acknowledge BNF's authority without over-stating Titan's role
- **Specific over abstract** — "In clinical checks" not "throughout the system"

## Avoid

- "We're thrilled to announce..."
- "Game-changing partnership"
- "Revolutionary integration"
- Partner-centric framing ("BNF and Titan together...")

## Production Notes

- To-camera, clean background
- Natural pacing, deliberate delivery
- No background music or effects
- Focus on speaker, not graphics or animations
- Professional but approachable setting
