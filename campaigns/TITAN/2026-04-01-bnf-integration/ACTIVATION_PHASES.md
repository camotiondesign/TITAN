# BNF Integration: Activation Phases

This document outlines the three-phase proof-first activation strategy for BNF integration.

---

## Phase 1: Quiet Activation (Months 1-2)

**Objective:** Embed BNF data, test in real pharmacies, gather proof points

**Activities:**
- BNF data integration into Titan PMR and Titanverse
- Beta testing with 5-10 pharmacies
- Collect specific use cases: "Before, I left Titan to check BNF. Now, it's there."
- Document time saved, context switching reduced, safety improvements

**No external communication.** This is infrastructure work, not marketing.

**Success Criteria:**
- BNF data successfully embedded in Titan PMR clinical checks
- BNF data successfully embedded in Titanverse decision support
- Beta pharmacies using feature without issues
- Initial use cases documented

---

## Phase 2: Proof Collection (Month 3)

**Objective:** Gather quantified evidence of impact

**Activities:**
- Case study interviews with beta pharmacies
- Quantify: time saved per check, reduction in external BNF lookups, pharmacist confidence
- Document specific scenarios: "BNF guidance surfaced for X interaction, prevented Y issue"
- Capture testimonials focused on workflow, not partnership

**Still no announcement.** Build proof first.

**Success Criteria:**
- 3-5 beta pharmacy testimonials captured
- Each testimonial includes specific scenario (e.g., 'BNF guidance appeared during X check, prevented Y issue') OR quantified benefit (e.g., 'Saves 2-3 minutes per complex check')
- Testimonials focus on workflow improvement, not partnership excitement
- If testimonials are generic, extend Phase 2 until specific proof is available

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How much time is saved per clinical check?
- How many external BNF lookups are eliminated?
- What specific scenarios demonstrate value?
- How does this improve pharmacist confidence?

## Phase 3: Proof-First Communication (Month 4+)

**Objective:** Communicate the upgrade through proof, not partnership

**Primary Format: Carousel (7-8 slides)**
- Slide 1: Hook — "BNF is now in Titan PMR and Titanverse"
- Slide 2: The Problem — "Pharmacists leave their PMR to consult BNF mid-check"
- Slide 3: The Solution — "BNF data appears automatically in clinical checks"
- Slide 4: Titan PMR Impact — Specific moments, not features
- Slide 5: Titanverse Impact — Service decisions, not abstract support
- Slide 6: Proof — Beta pharmacy testimonial with specific scenario OR quantified benefit (only include if proof is ready)
- Slide 7: What This Means — "The same source you trust for professional practice, exams, and clinical defence. Now it's where you check prescriptions."
- Slide 8: CTA — "See BNF integration in action"

**Supporting Formats:**
- **Single image testimonial** — Pharmacist quote about workflow improvement (not partnership excitement)
- **Short video (optional)** — 30-60 second explanation of where BNF appears in workflow
- **Leadership video (mandatory)** — 60-90 second to-camera explanation
- OR if leadership video is not produced, document explicit reason and ensure carousel + caption alone meet tone calibration requirements

**Formats to Avoid:**
- Joint press release (too partner-centric)
- "Partnership announcement" framing (shifts focus from infrastructure to marketing)
- Long-form video announcing partnership (too promotional)
- Generic "BNF integration" messaging without proof

**Success Criteria:**
- Campaign reaches 5,000+ impressions (based on NHS Independent Prescribing precedent)
- Comments and engagement indicate understanding of workflow benefit (not partnership excitement)
- No narrative drift toward partner-led messaging in comments or reposts
- Clinical trust increases through proof, not promotion
- Titan maintains narrative control

## Notes

- Phases are sequential. Do not move to Phase 3 until Phases 1-2 are complete.
- Proof is non-negotiable. If proof is weak, extend Phase 2.
- Communication quality depends on proof quality. Better proof = stronger campaign.
