## Notes

- Campaign follows proof-first activation strategy
- Success metric: Impressions (not engagement rate, which is inflated for carousels)
- Target: 5000+ impressions based on NHS Independent Prescribing precedent (5,655 impressions)
- Tone: Infrastructure upgrade, not partnership announcement
- Titan leads narrative; BNF validates source
