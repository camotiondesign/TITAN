Most PMRs react to change.

The best ones create it.

Pharmacy workflows are evolving fast.

But not every system is keeping up.

Some PMRs set the standard.  
Others scramble to catch up.

Innovators:

• Automate workflows so pharmacists can focus on care.

• Build systems that reduce admin—not add to it.

• Solve inefficiencies before they even become problems.

Imitators:

• React to change years later.

• Patch outdated systems instead of fixing workflows.

• Leave pharmacists working around their tech—not with it.

The real issue isn't just slow systems.

It's PMRs that weren't built for modern pharmacy.

Pharmacies are under more pressure than ever—  
rising demand, tighter regulations, expanding services.

They don't need systems that catch up.  
They need systems that think ahead.
