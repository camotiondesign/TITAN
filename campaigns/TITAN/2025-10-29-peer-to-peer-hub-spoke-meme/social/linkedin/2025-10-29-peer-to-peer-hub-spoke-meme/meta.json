The labelled 'Pharmacy Owner' character looks back temptingly at an image showing a Hub and Spoke diagram, while walking alongside another diagram representing Peer-to-Peer networking. Text overlays compare 'Peer to Peer' and 'Hub & Spoke' as two models of prescription workflow across multiple branches. The caption at the bottom reads: 'WHEN YOUR PMR DOESN'T OFFER BOTH.' Visual message: a PMR that only supports one model limits flexibility — modern pharmacy requires both.",
