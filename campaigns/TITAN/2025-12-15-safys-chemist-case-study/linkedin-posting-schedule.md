## Rationale

### Why This Order Works

1. **Blog first:** Establishes authoritative source, full story available
2. **Video second:** Visual proof, human connection, drives emotional engagement
3. **Shorts third:** Maintains momentum, prevents drop-off, reaches scroll-stopping audience
4. **Carousel fourth:** Reinforces for engaged audience, captures new audience, drives action
5. **Single image last:** Long-tail reminder, doesn't compete with main assets

### Goal Alignment

- **Driving engagement:** Carousel format proven to drive exceptional engagement (111% for Priory)
- **Pushing clicks:** Carousel CTA drives traffic to case study
- **Creating FOMO:** Quantified safety stats create urgency for non-customers
- **Creating pride:** Inspector scepticism story and generational adoption create reshare value for existing customers

## Notes

- Dates are flexible and can shift based on content calendar, but maintain sequence
- Carousel should be posted 16-21 days after blog publication (following Priory pattern)
- Single image is optional and can be skipped if resources are limited
- Monitor carousel CTR against Priory benchmark (110%)
- Encourage existing Titan customers to reshare carousel for social proof
