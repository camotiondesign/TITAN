### Before Titan Quote

### Staff Confidence Quote
**Asif:** "I have the peace of mind now to know that my staff can handle the dispensary. In fact, I rarely go in the dispensary anymore, just for a coffee every now and then, but that's it, the odd control drug check. But other than that, the staff are well trained. They know what they're doing with Titan, and it's not, it's not rocket science."

### Patient Focus Quote
**Asif:** "I can sit here, do my jobs, spend time with my patients, and you know, a lot of our reviews will show that on Google as well. A lot of people appreciate that I'm spending time with them."

### Narrator Paraphrase
With Titan, staff handle the dispensary. Asif focuses on patients.

### Zero Worries Quote
**Asif:** "I have zero worries. Honestly, I it's, it's the best thing that's happened."

## SEGMENT 4: Closing (1:50-2:05)

### Recommendation Quote

### Closing Quote
**Asif:** "Well, if you're in this area and you're thinking about getting Titan, don't get it stick to paper and the smell of paper, nothing quite like the smell of paper. Honestly, you know you're gonna miss it. Stick to what you got, really, yeah, if you're anywhere else, take the plunge. Honestly, the best thing ever."

4. Closing competitive advice - **MEMORABLE ENDING**

### Timing Notes

### Editing Priorities

- Quick cuts between quotes
- Minimal narrator voiceover
- Let Asif's quotes carry the story
- B-roll should be dynamic and quick-paced
- **Transition quotes:** Use to create smooth narrative flow between segments
- **Visual transitions:** Match B-roll to transition quotes (e.g., show ProScript → Titan during "night and day difference")
