Meet Prab. When he's not picking up his niece, he's here in Orpington running Priory Pharmacy, and let's just say you can call him a smooth operator. We're doing nearly 16,000 items, and we do this without a robot, and there's no chaos. Everything's really calm and really organized.

But I did not want to have any other PMR other than Titan in here when we were redesigning this pharmacy, so I made sure I had about at least five batch flow stations. They can have 30 baskets in them each, so we can work on 150 patients simultaneously.

Here, Titan AI and Batch Flow are my two modules that I love the most and make the biggest difference to me in the pharmacy. The AI is currently checking and clearing about 70% of the prescriptions that we receive.

Now, Mr. Jones comes in, we know exactly at what stage their prescription is at, due to the Kanban boards on the Titan system. I literally put his details in or he shows me his collection code. It brings up his details on the device, and it tells me straight away where his prescription is.

One of the things I'm really proud about, and we're one of the early adopters for, is Titan stock control. In this one space alone, we worked out we can pick 60% of every single basket just standing here.

Five years ago, I would not be able to be having this conversation with you. I'd probably still be in my dispensary trying to check hundreds of baskets, being incredibly stressed. Thanks to Titan PMR, I'm probably still in community pharmacy. Otherwise I would have left a long time ago.

I've shown people Titan in the past. I can spend a whole hour with them and not be interrupted.

Titan is efficient. It's safe. And it lets us be patient centric without burning out the team or myself.

If someone was thinking about getting Titan, I would just tell them — just sign straight away. Titan has given me my work life balance back.
