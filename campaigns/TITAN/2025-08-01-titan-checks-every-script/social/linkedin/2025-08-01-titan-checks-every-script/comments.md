Other PMRs trying to copy TITAN mark an item as being clinically checked once and then don't require it to be checked again for 6–12 months.  

What happens if a new medication is prescribed in month two that interacts with medication marked as checked?  

The whole therapy needs assessing — every time.  

Titan carries out checks on every prescription, ensuring no assumptions are made and highlighting risk factors for pharmacists to review.

It's always the same with these "copy and paste" PMR providers.  

They hide lack of innovation behind a veneer of "efficiency," impacting safety and increasing risk.  

Efficiency must exist inside a clinically safe envelope.  

Real-time clinical checks, using tech appropriately — every time please.

Titan gets it. Patients aren't static — checks shouldn't be either. 🫡

Bang on, Mandeep. Static checks miss dynamic risks. Smarter systems need to move with the patient. 🙌
