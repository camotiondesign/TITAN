Titan checks every prescription. Every time.

Let us explain why.

Because that "routine repeat" from January?

Your patient's changed since then.

New meds.

New risks.

New reasons to recheck.

And yet…

Most systems still only check every 6 or 12 months.

It sounds efficient.

But it isn't safe.

Titan's different.

✔ High-risk → straight to the pharmacist
✔ Low-risk → checked by AI trained on pharmacists
✔ Barcode → confirms item, label, and patient match

Not about checking less.

About checking smarter.

Because safety isn't static.

And neither is your patient.
