# Short Clip Transcript – Cameron Paperless Testimonial

**Cameron:**  
The two new prescriptions, super easy. So no more flicking through the box. Misfire prescriptions. Everything is scanned onto the shelf using the several handheld devices. It empowers the dispenser stuff. Once you've clinically checked it, they can go ahead and complete the prescription and bag it and shelve it. First of all, works for pre dispensing. It is phenomenal how it handles it. No more manual printing out scripts. You can even go completely paperless. Use the AI checking. It's always like even puts the expiry date, batch number on the boxes. Handle your services very easy, any of the PMR systems. And it's my honest opinion, if you're a pharmacy owner or a manager, get out your contracts quickly, your time and switch you tighten it live. It's so much easier.
