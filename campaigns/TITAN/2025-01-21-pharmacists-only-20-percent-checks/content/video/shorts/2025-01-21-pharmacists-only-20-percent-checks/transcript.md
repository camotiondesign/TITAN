# Short Clip Transcript – Andy Testimonial

"Would you go back to your old PMR system? Never, surely, absolutely. Pharmacists are only having to be involved in about 20% of the accuracy checks, and with Titan X, their involvement in the clinical checks is assisted as well. We needed to move away from the pharmacist being bogged down with checking every single prescription. We needed to free up their time so that they could engage with all the new NHS priorities, which is where all the funding is at. Pharmacists have noticed the difference almost straight away. The dispensers are empowered to do a lot more in terms of their roles. They can complete a lot more prescriptions. Such an innovative platform, one of the things I've noticed has made a real difference in one of my shops is the way it manages electronic repeat dispensing. It will automatically schedule downloads every four weeks, or you can edit that to change the interval if need be you can pull them down if you need them earlier. Really flexible, but it means that we aren't taking hundreds of phone calls a month about electronic repeat dispensary prescriptions that need to be pulled down and dispensed. We can just tell patients to relax and come in when they're running out. So make a difference Absolutely. Yeah, it reduced the phone call significantly. Yeah."
