## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Strong statistic headline (20%):** Clear, specific statistic captured attention and communicated value
- **NHS priorities message resonated:** Content successfully connected AI efficiency to NHS priorities and funding opportunities
- **Clear delegation benefits:** Testimonial effectively communicated how AI enables delegation and empowers dispensers

### What Didn't Work

- **Could include a single measurable KPI:** Missing specific quantified reductions (e.g., phone calls per month)
- **Limited comments:** Only 3 comments despite 195 engagements suggests content was consumed but didn't spark discussion
- **No "before vs after" comparison:** Missing visual/text comparison showing transformation

### Audience Insights

- **NHS priorities messaging works:** Content connecting AI efficiency to NHS priorities and funding resonated
- **Delegation benefits important:** Audience values empowerment and delegation capabilities

## Recommendations

### For Future Similar Campaigns

- **Add quantified reductions (e.g., phone calls per month):** Include specific KPIs and measurable outcomes
- **Add "before vs after" in text overlay:** Create visual/text comparison showing transformation
- **Include multiple statistics:** Add additional quantified benefits (time saved, errors reduced, etc.)
- **Test carousel format:** Repurpose testimonial into carousel with statistics and benefits

### Content Adjustments
