  "notes": "Organic post. Exceptional performance: 53.4% engagement rate, 51.8% CTR. Reframing messaging resonated strongly with audience frustration. Content successfully reframed pharmacy challenges by positioning legacy PMRs as the problem, not pharmacies themselves. Discussion prompt encouraged comments including strong testimonial from Owen Keil that validated message and provided social proof."
