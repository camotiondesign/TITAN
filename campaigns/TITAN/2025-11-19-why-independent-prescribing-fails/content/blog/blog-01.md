**Summary:**  
This piece breaks down the real reason Independent Prescribing stalls inside most pharmacies and why the NHS 10 Year Plan will not land unless this changes. The article addresses the gap between having trained Independent Prescribers and actually being able to prescribe in practice.

**Key Points:**
- Most pharmacies have trained Independent Prescribers but they still cannot prescribe
- The issue is not unwillingness, flawed training, or IP being a bad idea
- Something far simpler is blocking Independent Prescribing
- Every owner, superintendent, and IP recognizes the problem
- The problem is capacity - pharmacists are trapped at the bench doing manual checking
- Workflow must be fixed to free pharmacists for clinical work
- Independent Prescribing will fail without time to prescribe
