Independent Prescribing should be the future.

So why will it struggle in 2026?

Every branch is training more IPs. Every policy document points to a more clinical role. But in reality, most pharmacists still start their day the same way they did ten years ago: clearing repeats, chasing stock and firefighting the bench.

Pharmacy First showed the demand is there.
What is missing is capacity.

Training more prescribers cannot overcome a workflow that gives them no time to prescribe.

Until the operational model changes, IP cannot scale.
The bottleneck is not skill. It is time.
