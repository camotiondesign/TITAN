Pharmacy didn't need another PMR.

It needed a new way of working.

For years, legacy systems forced pharmacies to work around outdated tech.

Titan flipped the script.

Before Titan:  
• Automatic printing buried pharmacies in paper.  
• Pharmacists manually checked every prescription.  
• No barcode validation meant errors slipped through.  
• Dispensers wasted time searching for missing items.  

Now? Hundreds of pharmacies run on Titan.

✅ Paperless workflows: Prescriptions stay digital.  
✅ AI checks: Running 40+ clinical safety checks to flag risks early.  
✅ Barcode validation: No errors, just accuracy.  
✅ Real-time tracking: Instant visibility, no searching.  

And it's working.

📈 Over 70% of surveyed pharmacies actively recommend Titan to others.  
⭐ Pharmacies switching to Titan report smoother workflows from day one.  
🚀 Dispensers and pharmacists say Titan is the most efficient PMR they've used.  

Other PMRs are just now catching up.

Titan set the standard years ago.
