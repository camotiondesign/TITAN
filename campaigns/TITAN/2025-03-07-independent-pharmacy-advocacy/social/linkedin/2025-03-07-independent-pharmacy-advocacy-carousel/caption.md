🚨 URGENT: Independent Pharmacies Are at Risk 🚨

More closures are coming. Unless we take action now!

MPs need to hear directly from you about the funding crisis threatening independent pharmacies. Every email sent increases pressure on Parliament to act.

Follow these 3 simple steps to make them listen:

🛑 Step 1: Find Your MP
📍 Use this link: https://lnkd.in/dc3W6aS

✉️ Step 2: Send an Email
📩 Use our template (see comments) or write your own

📧 Step 3: CC IPCN & Key MPs
Make sure to CC IPCN: office@ipcn.org.uk

Also, CC the following key MPs:
📌 Wes Streeting (Health Secretary): dhsc.publicenquiries@dhsc.gov.uk
📌 Rachel Reeves (Chancellor): public.enquiries@hmtreasury.gov.uk
📌 Keir Starmer (Prime Minister): keir.starmer.mp@parliament.uk

🚨 This is urgent. Every email counts. 

Find your MP, send your email and share this with other pharmacy owners.

Let's push for change!
