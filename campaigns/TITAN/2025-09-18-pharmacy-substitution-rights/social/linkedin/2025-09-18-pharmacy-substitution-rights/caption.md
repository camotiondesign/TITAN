Sure, Teslas can drive themselves.

But pharmacists cannot swap a pill.

That is where we are in 2025.

Patients are waiting up to three weeks for essential medicines.

Not because shelves are empty.

But because pharmacists are legally blocked from substituting.

The result:

👉 Patients left untreated

👉 Surgeries drowning in calls

👉 Pharmacies stuck in the firing line

The absurdity is obvious.

We trust machines to steer cars through traffic.

But not pharmacists to use their training when a drug is out of stock.

The CCA and others are pushing for substitution rights, deprescribing roles and more front line flexibility. The NHS 10 Year Plan points the same way.

The question is not whether pharmacy is ready.

It is whether the rules will catch up.
