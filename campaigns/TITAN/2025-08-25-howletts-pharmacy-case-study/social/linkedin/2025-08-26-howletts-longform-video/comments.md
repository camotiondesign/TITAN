Well said Pritee Panchmatia. TITAN PMR does not use technology for the sake of technology — it's for a common purpose: creating capacity to allow pharmacies to provide healthcare services to their communities. Congratulations on having the vision and achieving this goal.

Are NMS an integrated function of Titan?

**Reply — TITAN PMR**  
Yes. There is an integrated workflow that flags potential NMS at clinical check and handout, capturing consent. Actual intervention and follow up consultations are carried out on #Titanverse, our services platform.

That's great in terms of prescriptions, but what do we do when pharmacists have to answer the same question 20 times a day by phone or message? This is where SteoAI Agents + Automation comes into play — capturing every lead, booking appointments, follow-ups, reminders and saving hours of admin weekly. I'd love to connect and show what results we can achieve.
