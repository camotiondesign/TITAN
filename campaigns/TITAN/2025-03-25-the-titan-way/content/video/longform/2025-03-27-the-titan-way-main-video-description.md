## Video Description

A longform talking-head video explaining "The Titan Way." The video alternates between a presenter speaking directly to camera and animated visual overlays showing Titan's Kanban-style prescription board and 3D objects representing real-world pharmacy items such as paper stacks, shelves, fridges, and stock trays. The animations illustrate how paper-heavy workflows are replaced by a fully digital process, with visual transitions from cluttered physical scenes to clean, organised digital flows. The overall tone is explanatory and instructional, focused on modernising pharmacy workflows through Titan's digital-first system.
