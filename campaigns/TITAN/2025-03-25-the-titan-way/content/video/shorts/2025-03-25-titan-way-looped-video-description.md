## Video Description

A short, looped 3D animated video set against a dark, black background. At the start, large stacks of paper sit piled high on a desk, symbolising paperwork and administrative burden. The papers suddenly lift and blow away in a smooth, cinematic motion. As the desk clears, Titan's Kanban board is revealed beneath, clean and organised. The animation is slick and seamless, looping back to the beginning to reinforce the contrast between paper-heavy chaos and a streamlined digital workflow.
