Hub and spoke. Before the law changes.

Medichem Pharmacy shows how.

Currently, groups under a single entity can already implement hub & spoke strategies.

That's exactly what Jeet did.

He built a central hub, connected his four branches with Titan P2P, and reimagined what his team could do.

The results:

✅ Dispensers 4x more efficient

✅ 45% less stockholding across branches

✅ Pharmacists free to focus on services

✅ Patients walk into calmer, safer pharmacies

"Peer to peer is a brand new tool, which Titan has enabled us to use at the minute. And I think it's amazing, because if you are part of the same group, you could technically consider sending your prescriptions to be dispensed at your other branch." – Jeet Vadodaria

From 1st October, the same opportunity opens to every independent, whatever your structure. Medichem proves it can work, safely and profitably, with patients at the centre.
