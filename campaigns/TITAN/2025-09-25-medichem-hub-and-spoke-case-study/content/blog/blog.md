# How Medichem Built a Hub-and-Spoke Network with Titan

## The Challenge

When Jeet expanded from one pharmacy in Leeds to four branches across West Yorkshire, the limits of traditional dispensing became clear. Baskets piled up, stock was duplicated across sites, and pharmacists were tied to the bench late into the evening with little time for services or patients.

> "Even with clinical staff we were always firefighting. My heart would stop every time the phone rang, expecting it to be an error."

Scaling with the old model was unsustainable. Jeet needed a way to make the business more efficient, protect profitability, and give his team the freedom to focus on care.

## How They Did It

### Moving to Titan

Jeet moved his first pharmacy onto Titan in 2022. Within six months, all four branches were live. His newest branch launched with Titan from day one.

> "We moved our first branch onto Titan in 2022 and we have never looked back since then. With the last branch we did not even think twice. It was Titan from day one."

The switch gave him confidence to handle multiple sites and freed his staff from the grind of manual dispensing.

### Building the Hub

With Titan in place, Jeet created a central hub to handle routine dispensing, supported by spoke branches carrying out clinical checks.

> "The same dispenser who used to work in branch has become four times more efficient. From 12 to 15 items an hour, they are now doing 40 to 45."

Prescriptions are assembled centrally and returned clean and packaged, ready for patients to collect. This streamlined model means spoke branches can focus on patients instead of chasing baskets.

### Peer-to-Peer Flexibility

Jeet also uses Titan's peer-to-peer (P2P) functionality, which allows branches to share capacity in real time.

> "Peer to peer is a brand new tool, which Titan has enabled us to use at the minute. And I think it's amazing, because if you are part of the same group, you could technically consider sending your prescriptions to be dispensed at your other branch."

That flexibility gives Medichem a built-in contingency. If one site is short-staffed or the hub is disrupted, work can be redirected instantly.

> "That is where the beauty of peer to peer would be. It would just go back on the branch level. Even then, you can send a more efficient branch all your prescriptions from where you do not have enough staff for them to then continue."

---

### Safer, Smarter Stock Control

Using Titan's stock control features, Jeet has been able to cut stockholding by **45 percent** across his branches. Overstock is no longer wasted and duplication is avoided.

> "We have reduced about 45 percent of stock holding capacity at branch level at the minute by using peer to peer. We are not overstocked anymore. If there is excess in one branch, it gets utilised across the group."

This not only saves money but also ensures medicines are always available where they are needed.

### From Pharmacies to Health Clinics

For Jeet, the biggest shift is cultural. With dispensing handled in the background, branches are being redesigned as patient-first health clinics.

Pharmacists now spend their time on clinical services, prescribing, and patient care. Dispensers and technicians are being trained to take on new roles such as vaccinations and PGDs.

> "We are now in a position where the branches are health clinics. Patients come for advice and services. Prescriptions are just something on the shelf, like picking up milk from Asda."

## The Results

- Dispensers **four times more efficient** (12–15 → 40–45 items/hour)  

- **45% reduction** in branch stockholding  

- **Around 50%** prescriptions filtered by Titan AI  

- Pharmacists freed to deliver NHS and private services  

- Fewer errors and a calmer, safer workflow  

- Owner regained family time and balance away from the bench  

> "Titan has simplified my life and my team's life at every stage of dispensing. It has been a life-changer as a pharmacist, as a contractor, and as a dad."

## The Takeaway

From October 2025, UK legislation will open hub and spoke to independents for the first time. For many, it remains an abstract policy change.

Medichem Pharmacy shows what it looks like in practice. With Titan P2P, independents can run hub and spoke safely, profitably, and with patients at the centre.

> "Dispensing should be the last thing on everybody's mind. Titan tells us: do not worry about dispensing. We will look after it."

Hub and spoke is coming. The question for independents is whether they will be ready.
