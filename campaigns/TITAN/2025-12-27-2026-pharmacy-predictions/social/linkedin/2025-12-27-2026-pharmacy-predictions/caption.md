2026 is going to be a defining year for pharmacy.

We've been watching the trends. Talking to hundreds of pharmacies. Seeing what's working and what's not. And the patterns are clear.

Here's what we see coming:

AI isn't optional anymore. By the end of 2026, AI-powered clinical checks will be standard. Pharmacies still doing 100% manual checks will struggle to compete. The question won't be "should we use AI?" but "which AI system works best for our workflow?"

Services revenue will double. Pharmacy First, weight loss clinics, travel health, ear care—the services explosion is just getting started. Pharmacies that haven't built service workflows will fall behind. The ones that have? They'll scale faster than ever.

Paperless becomes mandatory. Not preferred. Required. Regulations are pushing for fully digital workflows. Pharmacies still printing tokens and labels will face compliance challenges. The transition isn't coming—it's here.

Hub-and-spoke will accelerate. More pharmacy groups will centralize dispensing. The PMRs that don't support both peer-to-peer and hub-and-spoke will lose market share. Flexibility will be key.

But here's the biggest shift: pharmacist time becomes the currency. The pharmacies winning in 2026 won't be the ones with the most staff. They'll be the ones that free up the most pharmacist time. Time for services. Time for patients. Time for growth.

We're seeing it already. Pharmacists spending 85% of their time on services instead of checking scripts. Teams scaling to 17,000 items without adding staff. Near misses dropping by 97% because the system prevents errors before they happen.

2026 will separate the pharmacies that adapt from the ones that don't.

What's your prediction for 2026? What trends are you watching? What changes do you see coming?

Drop it in the comments. Let's shape the future together.
