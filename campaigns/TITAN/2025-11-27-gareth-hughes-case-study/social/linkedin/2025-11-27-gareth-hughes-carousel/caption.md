Another incredible independent pharmacist shaping the future of community care ✨

👉 Meet Gareth Hughes

Gareth spent years in senior roles across large organisations, but something was missing.
He wanted real patient contact.
He wanted to give back to a community he could feel connected to.
He wanted face-to-face conversations, not dashboards and performance figures.

So he made the move into independent community pharmacy.
And what happened next is a story worth reading.

From service delivery to business growth to the decisions that shaped his workflow, Gareth has transformed Tynewydd Pharmacy with a clear vision and a commitment to genuine patient care.

He won Independent Pharmacist of the Year at the Independent Pharmacy Awards.

A well-earned moment for a pharmacist who chose people over spreadsheets and built a practice that genuinely serves his community.
