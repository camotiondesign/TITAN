## Video Description

A looping video showing the TITAN PMR team standing together in white hoodies on a futuristic exhibition stand. The background continuously transitions from the bright blue "TITAN" logo to the purple "TITANVERSE" logo, symbolising the evolution from dispensing platform to services ecosystem. The team raise their fists in celebration as the stand lights and backdrop shift colour to match each brand identity. Filmed as a bold, high-energy announcement ahead of The Pharmacy Show.

**Note:** This is a looping video with no spoken dialogue. The description above outlines the visual sequence and brand transition.
