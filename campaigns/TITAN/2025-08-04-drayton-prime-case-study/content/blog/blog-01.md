# Drayton Prime's 32K-Item Pharmacy That Runs Without the Owner

Drayton Prime Pharmacy is a high-volume, service-led pharmacy based in Portsmouth. It dispenses over 32,000 items a month, supports 30 care homes, and delivers hundreds of clinical services, including more than 350 NMSS each month. Since switching to TITANVERSE, the team has eliminated overtime, fully digitised their workflow, and built a calm, scalable operation led by a confident team and one very hands-off owner.

## The Challenge

With over 32,000 items a month and a growing number of care home and clinical service commitments, Drayton Prime was operating at serious scale. But the systems behind the scenes weren't built for it. Everything was manual, fragmented, and dependent on pharmacist intervention. Scripts had to be hunted down. Workflows were disjointed. And as the volume climbed, so did the stress.

For owner Akbar, the goal was clear. He wanted a pharmacy that could grow without chaos. One that ran smoothly whether he was on-site or not. That meant building around the right system, empowering the team, and removing the friction that made high-volume pharmacy feel overwhelming.

## How They Did It

Akbar isn't your typical pharmacy owner. He runs six pharmacies, spends his time exploring new tools and strategies, and rarely gets dragged into the day-to-day.

> "Day to day wise… I'm not involved at all. Titan gives me that time."

> — Akbar

Drayton Prime is his highest-volume pharmacy and the one that proves his model works. The system runs. The team leads. And the numbers speak for themselves.

> "We're doing near 2,000 items a day. But we finish everything."

> — Akbar

Before Titan, the picture was different. Akbar inherited a manual, paper-heavy workflow running on ProScript Connect. Scripts were constantly being printed, checked, repackaged and re-checked. Pharmacists were firefighting, and visibility was low.

> "We used to stay till 2am. One staff member looked at me and said, 'This is hell.'"

> — Akbar

Akbar knew the goal wasn't just to digitise. It was to delegate, trust, and build a system that didn't depend on his presence or constant pharmacist intervention.

## Calmer, Simpler Workflows from Day One

Since switching to Titan, Drayton Prime has become fully paperless. Every prescription is trackable, auditable and visible to the whole team — whether it's urgent, batched, or waiting to be picked.

> "You don't have to have eyes at the back of your head anymore. Everything is there."

> — Maleeha

> "There's nowhere to hide. That's fantastic from my point of view."

> — Akbar

Batch processing and Kanban boards let the team manage large volumes without losing control. Care home prescriptions are grouped and processed together. Walk-ins are handled quickly with real-time shelf tracking.

> "Owings? On Monday there might be 30. By Friday? We're down to two."

> "Before, someone would ask for a script and we'd panic. Now we can find it in 30 seconds."

> — Akbar

This visibility doesn't just make the pharmacy more efficient. It changes the mood.

> "You can have calm conversations with the team. Before, it was just tense and reactive."

> — Akbar

## AI on Autopilot, Time Back for People

Titan AI handles around 70% of the clinical checking at Drayton Prime. That means pharmacists don't have to spend all day signing off baskets and can instead support the team or deliver care.

> "My workload has reduced dramatically. I'm not glued to the screen anymore."

> "Previously, I'd be checking all evening. Now? If I finish at 4:30, I go home at 4:30."

> — Maleeha

Titan's safety checks flag anything that needs attention. But most prescriptions are automatically cleared, dispensed, and bagged by the team — with no need for pharmacist touch unless required.

> "It's like a second pair of eyes. And it lets me actually do my job."

> — Maleeha

Even when Maleeha isn't physically in the pharmacy, she can log in remotely and support the team from home. Urgent prescriptions can be flagged and followed up with a call. No stress. No overtime.

## Scaling Services Without Adding Pressure

With Titan doing the heavy lifting, Drayton Prime has scaled up clinical services safely and confidently. NMSS alone has grown from almost zero to over 350 a month. The team also supports 30 care homes using Titan Batch, and regularly delivers services like earwax removal and Pharmacy First.

> "Before Titan, we weren't really doing NMSS. Now we're near 350 a month."

> — Akbar

> "We batch everything. Especially the care homes. And it all just gets done."

> — Maleeha

Titan also allows the pharmacy to prioritise scripts in real time. If someone's walking in, their prescription can be flagged, picked and prepared before they arrive. And when patients come to collect, the team knows exactly where the item is — whether it was dispensed 10 minutes ago or yesterday.

> "We used to have 200 Owings. Now it's usually two."

> — Akbar

## Trust the Team. Trust the System. Step Back.

Perhaps the most powerful part of Drayton Prime's transformation isn't the software or the AI. It's the shift in mindset. Akbar has built a business that runs without him — not by micromanaging less, but by building a team and system he trusts.

> "I trained these guys. I know what they're capable of."

> "I can't fault the system. I can't fault them. So why do I have to worry?"

> — Akbar

That philosophy has paid off. Akbar now spends his time testing new ideas, exploring strategic moves, and supporting his wider group of pharmacies. He jokes that the only time the team wants him in is to bring food.

> "They don't need me there. And it probably works better when I'm not."

> "Drayton Prime is a modern pharmacy that runs whether you're there or not. It just gets the job done."

> — Akbar
