A sharply dressed, intense-looking pharmacist stands in a dimly lit dispensary with medication shelves blurred behind him. He stares directly into the camera while holding out a prescription label as if it is a dramatic reveal. The composition mimics a movie poster, parodying psychological thriller tropes.",
