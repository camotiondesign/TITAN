## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Authentic and trustworthy delivery:** Unedited format creates credibility and trust
- **Unscripted endorsement:** Real customer voice without polish feels genuine
- **Demonstrates real operational change:** Shows concrete improvements (safety, efficiency, paperless operations, pharmacist freedom)
- **Trust value:** Raw content builds trust when paired with future edits or repurposed content

### What Didn't Work

- **Engagement and reach modest:** 684 impressions, 4.4% engagement rate lower than expected
- **No storytelling structure:** Raw format lacks narrative arc or emotional framing
- **No emotional framing or narrative conflict:** Missing hooks, tension, or structured storytelling
- **Limited watch time:** Average 10 seconds suggests audience doesn't engage with full raw conversation

### Audience Insights

- **Trust over engagement:** Raw format builds trust but doesn't drive high engagement
- **Needs framing:** Content requires hooks, segmentation, and narrative structure to perform
- **Repurposing value:** Strong foundation for future content but needs editing/segmentation for impact

## Recommendations

### For Future Similar Campaigns

- **Repurpose into short clips with captions:** Break raw conversation into digestible clips with text overlays
- **Add "Before Titan / After Titan" carousel:** Create visual comparison using key quotes and benefits
- **Use key quotes as standalone posts:** Extract powerful quotes for individual social posts
- **Add storytelling structure:** Frame raw content with hooks, conflict, and resolution

### Content Adjustments

- **Keep:** Authentic format, unscripted delivery, real operational proof
- **Add:** Text overlays, before/after comparisons, quote extraction, narrative framing
- **Test:** Short clips, carousel format, quote-led posts, edited versions with hooks

### Process Improvements

- **Transcript extraction:** Add transcript for clip generation, quote extraction, and context search
- **Repurposing workflow:** Develop process for breaking raw testimonials into multiple formats
- **Framing strategy:** Create template for adding hooks and narrative structure to raw content

---

## Next Steps

- Add transcript when available for:
  - Clip generation
  - Quote extraction
  - Context search
  - Callbacks in future campaigns
- Repurpose into short clips with captions
- Create "Before Titan / After Titan" carousel
- Extract key quotes for standalone posts

## Campaign Context

**Key Insight:**
Low reach but strong format validation — raw conversation holds trust value when paired with future edits or repurposed content.

**Significance:**
This campaign demonstrates the value of authentic, unedited testimonials for building trust, though raw format requires repurposing and framing for optimal engagement. The format validates trust-building approach while highlighting need for structured storytelling.
