## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Human and community-centred tone:** Messaging resonated with pharmacy professionals
- **Seasonal timing increasing goodwill:** Posted before holiday break maximized appreciation impact
- **Light-hearted visual reinforces message:** Snowman graphic with pharmacy role labels created engaging visual
- **Brand alignment:** Reinforced Titan's positioning as aligned with pharmacy community

### What Didn't Work

- **Click-through predictable low for non-product content:** 3.7% CTR expected for appreciation messaging
- **Message not tied to 2025 roadmap or value link:** No forward-looking connection or product tie-in
- **Limited conversation:** Only 2 comments suggests message was consumed but not discussed

### Audience Insights

- **Appreciation over engagement:** Audience sees this as appreciation, not CTA
- **Community value:** Reposts (4) and positive reactions indicate community appreciation
- **Seasonal relevance:** Timing before holiday break maximized impact
