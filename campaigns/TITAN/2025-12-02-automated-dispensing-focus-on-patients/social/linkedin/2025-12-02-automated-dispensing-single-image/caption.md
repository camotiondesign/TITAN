The pharmacist is now busier than ever.

Just not with checking everything. 👀

On Titan, checking has dropped to around 20–30 percent of items.
The baskets keep moving. The day does not vanish into repeats.

It is not more staff.
It is not robots.
It is not cutting corners.

It is a dispensing system that does the lifting for you.
