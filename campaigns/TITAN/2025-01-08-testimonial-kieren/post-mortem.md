## Learnings

### What Worked

- **Powerful measurable result:** NMS 30 → 180 per month (6x growth) provides concrete, quantifiable proof
- **Strong emotional hook:** Stress → freedom transformation narrative resonates with pharmacy audience
- **Remote working capability highlighted:** Work-from-home flexibility addresses modern work-life balance needs
- **Relatable testimonial:** Real pharmacist voice addressing common pain points (burnout, late nights, stress)

### What Didn't Work

- **No direct conversation in comments:** 0 comments despite strong engagement suggests passive consumption
- **Could have used stronger CTA in caption:** Caption lacked cliffhanger or question prompt to drive discussion
- **Limited engagement depth:** High CTR but no conversation indicates testimonial-driven but not discussion-driven

### Audience Insights

- **Emotional resonance:** Burnout/work-life balance messaging strongly resonates with pharmacy professionals
- **Proof-driven:** Measurable results (NMS growth) provide credibility and conversion potential
- **Passive consumption:** High engagement but no comments suggests audience consumed but didn't engage in discussion
- **Testimonial value:** Real pharmacist voice increases relatability and trust

### Content Adjustments
