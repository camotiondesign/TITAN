"It saves the pharmacist so much time. We're now able to offer so many more services that we never have, never provided before. Never even thought we'd have time to whether it's filing, whether it's clinical checking, because if you're busy doing something, the staff can come to me, I can quickly do a clinical check right here, and then they can go back and bag it up. So much more efficient than any other PMR."
