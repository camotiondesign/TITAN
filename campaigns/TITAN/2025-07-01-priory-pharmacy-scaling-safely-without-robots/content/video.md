## Video Description

How do you scale a high-volume pharmacy without chaos, overtime, or a robot?

Prab, owner of Priory Pharmacy in Orpington, was close to leaving the profession.

Today, he runs one of the calmest and most efficient pharmacies in the UK.

He dispenses 16,000 items a month with a lean team and a fully digital workflow.

In this full case study, you'll learn:

 • Why Prab rebuilt his pharmacy around Titan PMR

 • How Titan AI handles 70% of clinical checks

 • What Batch Flow and Kanban tools do for daily operations

 • How Titan Mobile simplifies every collection

 • The real impact on team wellbeing, services, and future plans

This is not about adding features. It's about building with intention.

Meet prab When he's not picking up his niece. He's hearing Orpington running priory pharmacy, and let's just say you could call him a smooth operator. We're

doing nearly 16,000 items, and we do this without a robot, and there's no chaos. Everything's really calm and really organized. But I did not want to have any other PMR, other than Titan, in here when we were redesigning this farm, so I made sure I had about at least five batch flow stations. They're gonna have 30 baskets in the meat so we can work on 150 patients simultaneously. Here, Titan AI and batch flow are my two modules that I love the most and make the biggest difference to me in the pharmacy. That AI is currently checking and clearing about 70% of the prescriptions that we receive. Now, when Mr. Jones comes in, we know exactly at what stage their prescriptions at. Due to the Kanban boards on the Titan system, I literally put his details in or he shows me his collection code. It brings up his details on the device, and it tells me straight away where his prescription is. One of the things I'm really proud about, and we're one of the early adopters for, is Titan stock control. In this one space alone, we worked out we can pick 60% of every single basket just standing here five years ago, I would not be able to be having this conversation with you. I'd probably still be in my dispensary trying to check hundreds of baskets, being incredibly stressed thanks to Titan. PMR, I'm probably still in community pharmacy. Otherwise I would have left a long time ago. I've shown people Titan in the past. I can spend a whole hour with them and not be interrupted. Titan is efficient. It's safe, and it lets us be patient centric, without burning out the team or myself. If someone's going thinking about getting Titan, I would just tell them, just sign straight away, Titan has given me my work life balance back i.
