# Carousel Slides – Impersonal to Personal

## Slide 1 – Hook
- **On-slide text:**  
  DOING A CONSULTATION ON PAPER NOW, IT ACTUALLY FEELS PRETTY IMPERSONAL WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Headline in bold typography reads "DOING A CONSULTATION ON PAPER NOW, IT ACTUALLY FEELS PRETTY IMPERSONAL WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT." Visual theme: Paper forms, manual process, disconnected consultation aesthetic. Clean white background with paper forms/clipboard visible. Red or muted color tones suggesting the impersonal/outdated nature.

## Slide 2 – Before: Paper Consultation
- **On-slide text:**  
  BEFORE TITANVERSE: EVERYTHING WAS MANUAL. EVERYTHING WAS ON PAPER.
  
  **Quote:**  
  "Before Titanverse, we would have been using a booking platform to be able to take the booking of that patient coming in. We would have then been using a manual piece of paper for the patient to do a risk assessment. I'd have been using a manual piece of paper to then write prescription. I'd have then needed to file that away. I then would have needed to go onto the PMR to enter it in as a prescription."
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Visual: Paper forms, clipboard, pen, manual prescription pad scattered across a workspace. Quote text displayed below header. Shows manual, disconnected process. Chaotic, fragmented aesthetic. Background: light grey/white with red accent colors suggesting inefficiency.

## Slide 3 – Before: Impersonal Experience
- **On-slide text:**  
  YOU'RE TYPING. FACING AWAY FROM YOUR PATIENT. IT FEELS IMPERSONAL.
  
  **Body text:**  
  Paper forms. Manual risk assessments. Writing prescriptions by hand. Typing notes afterwards. You're facing away from your patient. Focused on the screen. Not on the conversation.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Visual: Pharmacist facing away from patient, typing on laptop, patient in background looking disconnected. Split view showing the disconnect. Quote/body text displayed prominently. Shows disconnected, impersonal consultation dynamic. Background: muted colors, emphasizing the problem.

## Slide 4 – After: Face-to-Face Conversation
- **On-slide text:**  
  WITH TITANVERSE: YOU'RE FACING YOUR PATIENT, HAVING A REAL CONVERSATION.
  
  **Body text:**  
  I'm sitting facing the patient, looking at them, having a conversation with them. Yes, I may need to look back every so often to check what the questions were, but because it's picking it all up, I don't need to sit there typing away afterwards.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Visual: Pharmacist facing patient directly, making eye contact, natural conversation, tablet/screen in background (not focus). Clean, connected aesthetic. Body text displayed below header. Shows connected, personal consultation dynamic. Titanverse purple UI theme visible. Background: warm, professional tones emphasizing connection.

## Slide 5 – After: Voice Transcription Working
- **On-slide text:**  
  VOICE TRANSCRIPTION WRITES THE NOTES. YOU DON'T NEED TO TYPE AFTERWARDS.
  
  **Body text:**  
  Voice transcription writes the notes as you consult. It saves you time. It makes a more friendly experience for the patient. That saved me time during to make it more friendly experience for the patient. And again, where what software or what multiple softwares, has ever allowed you to do that before? None since Titanverse.
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Visual: Voice transcription interface working in background, pharmacist maintaining eye contact with patient, notes appearing automatically. Product UI showing voice transcription in action. Body text displayed. Shows technology enabling human connection. Titanverse purple UI theme. Background: clean, modern, emphasizing the seamless experience.

## Slide 6 – Outcome: Increased Uptake
- **On-slide text:**  
  MORE PERSONABLE CONSULTATIONS. MORE FRIENDLY EXPERIENCES. MORE HUMAN CONNECTION.
  
  **Quote:**  
  "And since we've been giving those consultations, as I mentioned, more personable and more friendly face to face, we've definitely seen an increase in uptake."
- **Alt text / description:**  
  Visual: Positive outcome representation - growth chart or increased engagement visual. Clean, minimal design with quote displayed prominently below header. Shows measurable benefit from improved experience. Background: positive, forward-looking aesthetic with Titanverse purple accents.

## Slide 7 – Close
- **On-slide text:**  
  MORE PERSONABLE. MORE FRIENDLY. MORE HUMAN.
  
  **Sub-head:**  
  That's the difference. Titanverse.
