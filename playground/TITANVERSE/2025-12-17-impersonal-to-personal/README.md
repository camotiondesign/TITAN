# Impersonal to Personal

Carousel campaign showcasing consultation experience transformation - how manual/paper consultations feel impersonal compared to Titanverse-enabled face-to-face human connection, leading to increased uptake.

## Primary Asset

- Carousel (7 slides)

## Supporting Assets

- LinkedIn post

## Strategic Note

Carousel effectively demonstrates consultation experience transformation through emotional contrast between impersonal paper consultations and personal Titanverse-enabled face-to-face conversations. Based on early adopter insight that paper consultations "actually feel pretty impersonal" and that more personable Titanverse consultations led to "definitely seen an increase in uptake." Builds on Monday's operational validation with human experience narrative. Creates intrigue by making pharmacists question their current consultation approach.
