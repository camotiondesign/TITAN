# TITANUP 2026 — POSITIONING (LOCKED)
## Obviously Awesome Framework Applied to TitanUp

**Version:** 1.0
**Locked:** February 22, 2026
**Framework:** April Dunford's *Obviously Awesome*
**Status:** ✅ LOCKED — All TitanUp content traces back to this document

---

## THE POSITIONING STATEMENT

> **TitanUp is a Titan user event and the only event in UK pharmacy dedicated to private profit — and how to actually get it.**

One sentence. This is the line. Every script, every caption, every design brief references this.

---

## STEP 1: COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES

What would they do instead of attending TitanUp?

| Alternative | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| Pharmacy Show | Exhibition. Corporate. Generic. Vendors selling AT you |
| CCA/NPA conferences | Policy talk. No action. No revenue playbook |
| Vendor webinars | Product demos dressed as education |
| Online CPD | Theory. No peer connection. No implementation |
| Figure it out alone | Slow. Expensive. Trial and error |
| Do nothing | Stay on the NHS treadmill |

**The real alternative is inertia.** Most pharmacy owners know they need to diversify. They just don't know where to start. There's no resource, no event, no playbook that shows them HOW.

---

## STEP 2: UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES

What does TitanUp have that none of those alternatives do?

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Titan user event** | Everyone in the room is on the same platform or seriously considering it |
| **Dedicated to private profit** | Not dispensing, not compliance, not CPD. Revenue. |
| **How to ACTUALLY get it** | Not theory. The mechanics. The numbers. The playbook. |
| **200 pharmacy owners** | Peers, not vendors. Owners, not reps. |
| **Speakers who've done it** | Not speakers who advise on it |
| **Both PMR + services** | Titan (dispensing transformation) AND Titanverse (services revenue) in one room |
| **Tariq + leadership** | Roadmap for what's coming. Built by pharmacy people. |
| **TitanUp 2023 track record** | People came back changed |

---

## STEP 3: VALUE

What does this actually create for the attendee?

- **Clarity** — exactly what the next 12 months should look like for their pharmacy
- **The numbers** — what to charge, what they earn, how they got there (real pharmacies, not theory)
- **The Titanverse roadmap** — what's coming that makes private profit easier
- **A network** — 200 owners who are already doing it or about to start
- **Confidence** — to price, market, and deliver private services
- **A plan** — leave knowing what to do Monday morning

---

## STEP 4: BEST-FIT CUSTOMERS

Who cares most about this value?

### Primary
Titan customers (existing users) who've optimised dispensing and are now ready to build services revenue. They've solved the PMR problem. TitanUp shows them what's next.

### Secondary
Pharmacy owners who aren't on Titan yet but have been following the content. They see the transformation stories and want to understand how.

### Also
- Independent prescribers who want to build a profitable clinic inside their pharmacy
- Owners who are tired of being told "do more services" without anyone showing them how

### NOT For
- People looking for CPD tick-boxes
- Corporate pharmacy managers sent by head office
- Tyre-kickers looking for free stuff

---

## STEP 5: MARKET CATEGORY

| Category Frame | What It Implies | Why It Fails for TitanUp |
|---|---|---|
| "Pharmacy conference" | Talks, stands, CPD | Commoditised. Pharmacy Show owns this. |
| "User conference" | Product roadmap, demos | Makes it sound like a sales event |
| "Transformation event" | Come broken, leave fixed | Implies attendees are struggling |
| "Industry summit" | Policy, big picture | Too abstract, no action |

**None of these work.**

### The Category TitanUp Owns

> **The UK's only pharmacy event dedicated to private profit.**

Nobody else is in this space. Not because they can't be — because they're not even in the conversation. Titan created the category.

---

## THE INVISIBLE ENEMY

The enemy is NOT the NHS. Pharmacists believe in the NHS. They serve it. They grew up in it.

The enemy is **the funding model** — the structure that:

- Tells you what you'll get paid (you don't set your prices)
- Lets suppliers charge what they want (you can't control your costs)
- Claws back money after you've already done the work
- Pays less every year while expecting more services
- Makes it impossible to build a sustainable business on dispensing alone

**The line:** "The NHS isn't paying us enough anymore" — states a financial fact without attacking the institution.

**Never say:** "The NHS is the problem" / "Abandon the NHS" / "Anti-NHS"
**Always say:** "The model" / "The funding structure" / "The economics" / "The deal"

---

## EMOTIONAL FRAMEWORK

TitanUp content should make pharmacy owners feel:

| Feeling | How |
|---|---|
| **Recognition** | "These people understand my business" |
| **Aspiration** | "There's a better model and people are already doing it" |
| **Belonging** | "I'm part of this group of forward-thinking owners" |
| **Urgency** | "The gap between those doing this and those who aren't is widening" |
| **Confidence** | "I don't need to figure this out alone" |

### What TitanUp Content Should NEVER Make Them Feel

| Avoid | Why |
|---|---|
| Desperate | Titan customers aren't struggling |
| Lectured at | Tariq stands with owners, not above them |
| Sold to | "So we built one" not "come to our event" |
| Political | The enemy is economics, not ideology |
| Guilty | The model is broken, not the owner |

---

## CONTENT APPLICATION

### Every TitanUp Post Must Answer

1. What's the problem? → **The funding model makes it impossible to grow on NHS alone**
2. What's the solution? → **Private profit: revenue you control**
3. Why TitanUp? → **The only event showing you how to actually do it**
4. Why now? → **The pharmacies doing this are pulling ahead right now**

### The Standalone Test

Every TitanUp post must deliver value even if they never register. If you deleted the CTA, would the post still perform?

### Tone

| Not This | This |
|---|---|
| "ARE YOU READY?!" | "This is what's coming." |
| Loud, shouty | Confident, clear, earned |
| "You need to be there" | "I'll see you there" |
| Desperation marketing | Category creation |
| Feature dump | Transformation proof |

## KEY LINES (APPROVED FOR USE)

These lines are locked and can be used across all TitanUp content:

| Line | Use |
|---|---|
| "The NHS isn't paying us enough anymore" | Opening / problem framing |
| "The only event in UK pharmacy dedicated to private profit" | Positioning statement |
| "So we built one" | Category creation moment |
| "Revenue the NHS can't touch" | Aspiration / vision |
| "Not theory. The playbook." | Differentiation |
| "200 pharmacy owners. One room." | Scale / proof |
| "June 7th. Birmingham." | CTA |
| "I'll see you there." | Personal close |
| "That's not a business model. That's a trap." | Funding model reframe |
| "No contract. No clawbacks. No one telling them what they can charge." | Freedom cascade |

---

## RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POSITIONING

| Entity | Positioning | Relationship to TitanUp |
|---|---|---|
| **Titan PMR** | The pharmacy operating system that frees you from the bench | TitanUp shows what you do AFTER you're free |
| **Titanverse** | The pharmacy services platform | TitanUp shows how to make it profitable |
| **TitanUp** | The UK's only event dedicated to private profit | Where PMR efficiency meets services revenue |

TitanUp is the bridge between "my dispensing is sorted" and "my business is growing."
