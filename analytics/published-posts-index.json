Still advising patients with the same care they always do.\n\nSome of your colleagues will not mention it.\nThey will just quietly get on with it, the way they always have.\n\nThis is your reminder to check in on them and show a little extra support this month.\n\n#RamadanMubarak #CommunityPharmacy #PharmacyLife #TitanPMR"

High-volume branches that used to need double cover. Not anymore 👇\n\nSunil runs operations across Hollywood Chemist. He doesn’t do drama.\n\nNo forced restructure. Just a system change that made double cover unnecessary.\n\nOne pharmacist now handles what two used to. Checking is faster. Services still happen. And the branches that once demanded double cover are running smoother than before.\n\n“We’re operating without double cover today, and the pharmacists within those branches now use AI. That frees them up to carry out services.”\n\nSame volume. Lower pharmacist hours. More clinical time, not less.\n\nThat’s the Titan way 💪\n\n#TitanPMR #PharmacyEfficiency #PharmacyAI"

Today, it's one of the busiest pharmacies in the area, dispensing 14,500 items every month.\n\nA year ago, the pharmacy was averaging 5-6 near misses per month. Pharmacist Asif was spending his entire nine-hour day checking prescriptions, running back and forth between the consultation room and dispensary. Baskets piling up. Constant worry about patient safety.\n\nSince switching to Titan, near misses have dropped to just 2 in an entire year.\n\nThe improvement is so significant that Asif jokes about inspector skepticism: \"I'm worried the inspector is going to come in, look at my near misses, and say, 'You can't have only made two mistakes in a year.'\"\n\nThis doesn't happen by asking people to be more careful. It happens when safety is designed into the workflow—when barcode scanning prevents wrong products from reaching patients, when the system won't let staff seal a bag if items are missing, when every item is tracked with batch numbers and expiry dates.\n\nThe numbers tell the story. But the real story is what changed: from constant worry to calm control, from chaos to confidence.\n\n📖 Read the full case study: [link to be added]\n\n#PharmacySafety #TitanPMR #DigitalPharmacy #PharmacyWorkflow #CommunityPharmacy #PharmacyOwner #PharmacyLife #PharmacyInnovation"

Together, we saw incredible transformations. Pharmacies scaling safely. Pharmacists stepping off the bench. Near misses dropping by 97%. Teams finding their flow.\n\nNow, it's time to aim higher.\n\nHere are the resolutions that will define 2026:\n\n**Scale safely.** More items shouldn't mean more chaos. Build workflows that handle growth without breaking. The goal? Scale without stress.\n\n**Free pharmacist time.** Get off the bench. Get into the consultation room. AI handles routine checks. You handle patient care. The goal? 80% of your time on services, not checking.\n\n**Expand services.** Pharmacy First. Weight loss. Travel clinics. Ear care. The money is in services, not just dispensing. The goal? Services revenue that matches dispensing.\n\n**Reduce near misses.** Safety isn't negotiable. Barcode scanning. AI checks. Real-time tracking. The goal? Near misses drop by 90%+.\n\n**Go paperless.** No more printing. No more tokens. No more waste. Fully digital workflows from start to finish. The goal? 100% paperless by end of 2026.\n\nWe've seen pharmacies achieve all of these in 2025. Sagar at Brighton Hill scaled to 17,000 items and spends 80% of his time on services. Asif at Safy's cut near misses by 97% and freed 85% of his time. Teams across the UK went fully paperless.\n\nIt's not about working harder. It's about building smarter.\n\nWhat's your pharmacy's #1 resolution for 2026? Share it below—we'd love to hear! 💡\n\nLet's make 2026 the year your pharmacy transforms.\n\n👉 Ready to see what's next?

The upside? Every consultation brings extra NHS income for your pharmacy.\n\nBut here's the challenge:\n\nMost pharmacy teams are stretched thin managing dispensing and day-to-day operations. To qualify for Pharmacy First consultation payments, you need to handle at least 25 consultations a month.\n\nThat's where automation and AI make the difference. Tools like Titan streamline workflows, automate admin tasks, and free up your team to focus on patients.\n\nThe results:\n\n• More consultations, more revenue.  \n\n• Faster, smarter patient care.  \n\n• A future-ready pharmacy that thrives under pressure.  \n\nWith the right systems, you can meet rising demand, grow private services, and keep your pharmacy running smoothly.\n\nHow has your pharmacy handled the shift? Let's discuss in the comments."
