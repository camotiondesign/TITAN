Spot the Diff - The GTIN doesn’t,"FB@TITAN PMR, IN@titanpmr, LI-PAGE@titanpmr",5890,,✅ Published,"Spot the difference. 

The GTIN doesn’t.

Right now in UK pharmacy, different medicines are arriving with the same GTIN barcode or a GTIN that does not match the product inside.

When that happens, the scanner passes the wrong medicine as correct. Every safety layer collapses.

Pharmacists are forced to slow down, override the check, and carry the risk that should sit with manufacturers and regulators.

This is not a workflow problem. It is a patient safety problem.

The fix is simple:
• Make accurate GTIN barcodes mandatory
• Treat incorrect GTINs as labelling errors
• Protect the final safety check that keeps patients safe

If you work in pharmacy, please add your name.
This is a small action that protects every dispenser in the country.

the Mounjaro Bomb,LI-PAGE@titanpmr,2771,,✅ Published,"💥 What was the Mounjaro Bomb that hit UK pharmacy last week?

Here’s what really changed 👇

From 1 September, Mounjaro’s list price jumps by up to 170%.

But the real shock isn’t just the cost. Pharmacies must now:
1️⃣ Pay the higher price upfront
2️⃣ File monthly rebate reports (splitting NHS vs private)
3️⃣ Wait for retrospective rebates — still unclear in detail

For independents running on tight margins, that’s a cashflow crisis.
For patients, it risks confusion, delays, and unsafe online alternatives.

That’s why within days, Titan PMR launched a custom reporting suite — now used by 1,000+ pharmacies to:
✔ Generate rebate data in minutes
✔ Stay compliant without drowning in admin
✔ Keep the focus on patients, not paperwork

Now?

• 6,500 items a month

✔ 18 active weight management clients

Jeets - Hub and Spoke,LI-PAGE@titanpmr,1412,,✅ Published,"Hub and spoke. Before the law changes.

Medichem Pharmacy shows how.

Most contractors are waiting for October 2025 to see if hub and spoke will work for independents.
But waiting could mean falling behind.

Jeet Vadodaria did not wait.
At Medichem Pharmacy, he built a central hub, connected his four branches with Titan P2P, and reimagined what his team could do.

The results:
✅ Dispensers four times more efficient
✅ 45% less stockholding across branches
✅ Pharmacists free to focus on services
✅ Patients walk into calmer, safer pharmacies

“Peer to peer is a brand new tool, which Titan has enabled us to use at the minute. And I think it’s amazing, because if you are part of the same group, you could technically consider sending your prescriptions to be dispensed at your other branch.” – Jeet Vadodaria

This October, hub and spoke becomes open to every independent.
Medichem proves it can work, safely and profitably, with patients at the centre.

We train our teams to double-check.
Triple-check.

But constant vigilance isn’t sustainable — it leads to exhaustion, not excellence.

We often say:
“Be careful.”
“Double-check everything.”
“Don’t miss a thing.”

But here’s the real question:
Why are we still designing systems that assume people won’t make mistakes?

The safest workflows don’t rely on perfect memory or superhuman focus.
They’re built to catch errors automatically.

📊 A 2024 NHS survey found pharmacists are one of the most trusted healthcare professionals in the UK.

But you can’t deliver clinical care if you’re buried in admin.
Not with a PMR that makes you do everything twice.
Not with systems that interrupt you 50 times a day.

To make this shift work, we need to fix three things:
