It works because patient nomination is meant to be clear, deliberate, and respected.\n\nBut there is a flaw. Some systems can automatically reverse a patient's pharmacy nomination, without the patient knowing.\n\nWhen that happens, prescriptions can bounce between pharmacies. Patients lose clarity about where their medicines are. Trust takes the hit first. And pharmacies playing fair are put at a disadvantage.\n\nAt scale, this creates risk for EPS itself. It was not designed for businesses to fight over nominations through automation.\n\nWe were asked to build this functionality. We refused. Not because we couldn't, but because it breaches our values around patient safety, professional standards, and fair competition.\n\nPatient choice must mean something.\n\n👉 Sign the petition: bit.ly/3YH8boA\n\n#PatientChoice #EPS #NHSPharmacy #PharmacyEthics #PatientCare #CommunityPharmacy",

Every safety layer collapses.\n\nPharmacists are forced to slow down, override the check, and carry the risk that should sit with manufacturers and regulators.\n\nThis is not a workflow problem.

The upside? Every consultation brings extra NHS income for your pharmacy.\n\nBut here's the challenge:\n\nMost pharmacy teams are stretched thin managing dispensing and day-to-day operations. To qualify for Pharmacy First consultation payments, you need to handle at least 25 consultations a month.\n\nThat's where automation and AI make the difference. Tools like Titan streamline workflows, automate admin tasks, and free up your team to focus on patients.\n\nThe results:\n\n• More consultations, more revenue.  \n\n• Faster, smarter patient care.  \n\n• A future-ready pharmacy that thrives under pressure.  \n\nWith the right systems, you can meet rising demand, grow private services, and keep your pharmacy running smoothly.\n\nHow has your pharmacy handled the shift?
