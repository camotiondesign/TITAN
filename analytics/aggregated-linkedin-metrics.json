Every safety layer collapses.\n\nPharmacists are forced to slow down, override the check, and carry the risk that should sit with manufacturers and regulators.\n\nThis is not a workflow problem. It is a patient safety problem.\n\nThe fix is simple:\n• Make accurate GTIN barcodes mandatory\n• Treat incorrect GTINs as labelling errors\n• Protect the final safety check that keeps patients safe\n\nIf you work in pharmacy, please add your name.\nThis is a small action that protects every dispenser in the country.\n\n👉 Sign the petition: bit.ly/3XNxapM\n\n#EveryPackCounts #PharmacySafety #GTIN #CommunityPharmacy #TitanPMR",

Pharmacies must now:\n\n1️⃣ Pay the higher price upfront\n\n2️⃣ File monthly rebate reports (splitting NHS vs private)\n\n3️⃣ Wait for retrospective rebates — still unclear in detail\n\nFor independents running on tight margins, that's a cashflow crisis.\n\nFor patients, it risks confusion, delays, and unsafe online alternatives.\n\nThat's why within days, Titan PMR launched a custom reporting suite — now used by 1,000+ pharmacies to:\n\n✔ Generate rebate data in minutes\n\n✔ Stay compliant without drowning in admin\n\n✔ Keep the focus on patients, not paperwork\n\nWhen global shocks land in local pharmacy…\n\n👉 Titan moves fast.\n\n#pharmacy #mounjaro #pmrreimagined #TitanPMR",

He added space. For clinics. For services. For growth.\n\nHere's what made it possible:\n\n💡 AI handles most clinical checks\n📦 Every script is tracked from inbox to collection\n📲 Patients get a text when it's ready\n⏱️ Same-day turnaround is the norm\n\nHe spends one hour a day in the dispensary.\n\nThe rest goes into services: travel clinics, contraception, ear care, weight loss.\n\n🧑⚕️ He even built a second consultation room.\n\nSagar isn't just scaling.\n\nHe's scaling with ease. He's leading by example.\n\n📖 Read the full story → bit.ly/4lOuT7S\n\n👏 Congratulations to Sagar and the team at Brighton Hill Pharmacy.\n\n💬 What would you do with 80% of your time back?\n\n#CommunityPharmacy #PharmacyServices #DigitalHealth #NHSPrimaryCare #TitanPMR #PharmacyInnovation",

The upside? Every consultation brings extra NHS income for your pharmacy.\n\nBut here's the challenge:\n\nMost pharmacy teams are stretched thin managing dispensing and day-to-day operations. To qualify for Pharmacy First consultation payments, you need to handle at least 25 consultations a month.\n\nThat's where automation and AI make the difference. Tools like Titan streamline workflows, automate admin tasks, and free up your team to focus on patients.\n\nThe results:\n\n• More consultations, more revenue.  \n\n• Faster, smarter patient care.  \n\n• A future-ready pharmacy that thrives under pressure.  \n\nWith the right systems, you can meet rising demand, grow private services, and keep your pharmacy running smoothly.\n\nHow has your pharmacy handled the shift?
