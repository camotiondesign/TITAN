Pharmacies must now:\n\n1️⃣ Pay the higher price upfront\n\n2️⃣ File monthly rebate reports (splitting NHS vs private)\n\n3️⃣ Wait for retrospective rebates — still unclear in detail\n\nFor independents running on tight margins, that's a cashflow crisis.\n\nFor patients, it risks confusion, delays, and unsafe online alternatives.\n\nThat's why within days, Titan PMR launched a custom reporting suite — now used by 1,000+ pharmacies to:\n\n✔ Generate rebate data in minutes\n\n✔ Stay compliant without drowning in admin\n\n✔ Keep the focus on patients, not paperwork\n\nWhen global shocks land in local pharmacy…\n\n👉 Titan moves fast.\n\n#pharmacy #mounjaro #pmrreimagined #TitanPMR",
