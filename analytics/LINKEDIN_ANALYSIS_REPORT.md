## 🎯 5 Punchy Takeaways

### 1. DOUBLE DOWN: Carousels are your secret weapon
**60.5% engagement rate, 64.5% CTR** — Carousels outperform every other format by 5-10x. They represent only 24% of your posts but drive the majority of your results. **Make carousels 50%+ of your content mix.**

### 2. DOUBLE DOWN: Write longer captions (151+ words)
**33.2% engagement vs 12.0% for short captions** — Longer captions get 2.5x better engagement and 1.5x more impressions. Your audience wants depth, not brevity. **Stop writing short captions.**

### 3. DOUBLE DOWN: Use 7+ hashtags
**27.2% engagement vs 8.4% for 1-3 hashtags** — More hashtags = better discovery and engagement. The data is clear: 7+ hashtags drive 3x better performance. **Never use fewer than 4 hashtags.**

### 4. STOP: Single images and polls are underperforming
**5.8% engagement (single images) and 3.9% (polls)** — These formats get less than half the engagement of carousels. Single images are your most common format (30% of posts) but deliver the worst results. **Deprioritize single images and polls.**

### 5. DOUBLE DOWN: Links are optional—focus on engagement first
**21.0% engagement without links vs 20.6% with links** — Links slightly hurt engagement quality but boost impressions. For maximum engagement, skip links. For maximum reach, include them. **Use links strategically, not by default.**
