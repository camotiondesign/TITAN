      "description": "15 pharmacies. High-volume branches that used to need double cover. Not anymore 👇\n\nSunil runs operations across Hollywood Chemist. He doesn’t do drama.\n\nNo forced restructure. Just a system change that made double cover unnecessary.\n\nOne pharmacist now handles what two used to. Checking is faster. Services still happen. And the branches that once demanded double cover are running smoother than before.\n\n“We’re operating without double cover today, and the pharmacists within those branches now use AI. That frees them up to carry out services.”\n\nSame volume. Lower pharmacist hours. More clinical time, not less.\n\nThat’s the Titan way 💪\n\n#TitanPMR #PharmacyEfficiency #PharmacyAI",

      "description": "What happens when a busy pharmacy group finally gets a clinical workflow that makes sense?\n\nFor BMP HEALTHCARE LTD, consultations used to be manual, scattered and slow — paper forms, missed questions, and countless systems pulling pharmacists away from the patient.\n\nThen they became one of the first adopters of Titanverse.\n\nNMS went live first, and everything changed:\n\n• One pharmacist running services centrally across the group\n• Senior management able to see the full workload in real time\n• AI-driven clinical pathways showing red flags and gateway criteria\n• Voice transcription capturing the whole consultation\n• Instant summaries and safe next-step suggestions\n• Tailored templates for travel, weight loss and Pharmacy First created on the spot\n• Digital prescriptions generated instantly, ready to dispense through Titan PMR\n\nEven experienced prescribers were surprised by the depth, clarity and safety of the system.\n\n“The AI is literally the greatest thing I’ve ever seen.”\n\nThis is the story of how BMP turned manual consultations into a fast, joined-up, patient-centred workflow using Titanverse.\n\n📖 Read the full case study: https://bit.ly/4nOpOgu\n🌐 Learn more: https://titanverse.com\n\n⸻\n\nFull Story & SEO Summary\n\nBMP Healthcare needed a safer, more efficient way to run clinical services across twelve branches. Titanverse gave them a single platform for NMS, Pharmacy First, travel health and weight management — complete with AI-guided pathways, automated templates, and real-time team visibility.\n\nThis video explores their early-adopter experience and the moment they realised they needed to level up their service model.\n\n⸻\n\nIn this Case Study, you’ll see 👇\n\n🧭 How BMP centralised NMS and improved group-wide visibility\n🧪 How AI pathways highlight red flags, missed questions and gateway criteria\n🎙️ How voice transcription transforms the patient conversation\n⚡ How instant summaries and digital prescriptions cut admin to zero\n📈 How Titanverse helps pharmacists deliver safer, more consistent services\n\n⸻\n\nChapters\n\n0:00 – Introduction\n0:22 – The problem with manual consultations\n0:55 – Becoming early adopters\n1:20 – NMS as the first live module\n1:55 – AI pathways and transcription\n2:40 – Templates and digital prescriptions\n3:10 – Why Titanverse changes everything\n\n⸻\n\nHashtags\n\n#Titanverse #PharmacyServices #AIinHealthcare #NMS #PharmacyFirst #DigitalHealth #ClinicalServices #CommunityPharmacy #HealthTechUK",

      "description": "What happens when an independent pharmacy does not wait for October 2025 — and builds hub and spoke ahead of the law?\n\nJeet Vadodaria, Director and Superintendent Pharmacist at Medichem Pharmacy in West Yorkshire, runs four branches and dispenses over 40,000 items a month. Instead of drowning in baskets and duplicate stock, he used Titan PMR and Titan P2P to create his own hub and spoke system.\n\nIn this full case study, you’ll see how Jeet:\n• Made dispensers four times more efficient (12–15 items/hour → 40–45)\n• Reduced stockholding across branches by 45%\n• Used Titan P2P to share workload instantly between sites\n• Built in contingency so the system never stalls\n• Freed pharmacists to focus on services and patient care\n• Reframed his branches as health clinics, not just dispensing units\n\n“Peer to peer is a brand new tool, which Titan has enabled us to use at the minute. And I think it’s amazing, because if you are part of the same group, you could technically consider sending your prescriptions to be dispensed at your other branch.” – Jeet Vadodaria\n\nFrom October 2025, hub and spoke will be open to every independent. Medichem Pharmacy shows what it looks like in practice.\n\n📖 Full case study: https://bit.ly/481Gih1\n\n#TitanPMR #PharmacyWorkflow #HubAndSpoke #IndependentPharmacy #CommunityPharmacy #PharmacyLeadership #AIinPharmacy #DigitalPharmacy #NHSPharmacy",

      "description": "What happens when a pharmacist replaces stress with calm — and builds a team that can thrive?\n\nPritee, Superintendent Pharmacist and owner of Howletts Pharmacy in Ruislip, was once buried in baskets, tied up in accuracy checks, and losing days on end-of-month claims. Services suffered, and growth felt out of reach.\n\nToday, her pharmacy looks very different:\n• 6,500 items a month dispensed with confidence\n• 50–60% of prescriptions AI-checked by Titan\n• 20–30% faster dispensing with Batch Flow\n• 60–70 BP checks every month (up from 10–15)\n• A growing private weight management service with 18 active clients\n• From 1 private consultation a month → to 2–3 every day\n• End-of-month claims done in minutes, not days\n\nFor Pritee, the biggest impact isn’t just efficiency. It’s culture.\n\n“Technology is wonderful, but it can’t replace people. Titan frees my staff up to be there for the community — and that’s what matters most.”\n\nThis is what pharmacy looks like when digital-first means human-first.\n\n📖 Read the full case study: bit.ly/3UMTaQq\n\n#PharmacyWorkflow #TitanPMR #AIinPharmacy #PharmacyServices #CommunityPharmacy #DigitalPharmacy #PharmacyLeadership #HowlettsPharmacy #NHSPharmacy",
