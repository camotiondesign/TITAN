15 pharmacies. High-volume branches that used to need double cover. Not anymore 👇

Sunil runs operations across Hollywood Chemist. He doesn’t do drama.

No forced restructure. Just a system change that made double cover unnecessary.

One pharmacist now handles what two used to. Checking is faster. Services still happen. And the branches that once demanded double cover are running smoother than before.

“We’re operating without double cover today, and the pharmacists within those branches now use AI. That frees them up to carry out services.”

Same volume. Lower pharmacist hours. More clinical time, not less.

That’s the Titan way 💪
