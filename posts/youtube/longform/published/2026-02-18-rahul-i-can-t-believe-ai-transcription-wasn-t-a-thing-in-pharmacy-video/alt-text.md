# Rahul - "I can't believe AI transcription wasn't a thing in pharmacy." – Alt Text

## Design Brief (from Notion)

Vertical/9:16 edit of Rahul's AI transcription clip for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Facebook, Instagram. Punchy, fast-paced style.

NOTE: Platforms field only has TikTok@titanpmr available. This should go on Titanverse social accounts (TikTok, YT, FB, Insta).

Hook (first 2 seconds): Text overlay 'Pharmacy note-taking was TERRIBLE' or 'Scraps of paper?!' with Rahul's voice starting immediately.

Quick cuts between the problem (scribbling, not looking at patient) and the solution (Titanverse transcribing).

Bold text overlays throughout:
- 'Scraps of paper'
- '10-20 mins saved per patient'
- 'Everything compliant'

End card: Titanverse logo + 'Link in bio'

Keep under 45 seconds. Front-load the hook. Titanverse pink-magenta to purple gradient on text elements.
