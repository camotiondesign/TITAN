Don’t rely on manual checking.

Use TITAN AI + Barcode scanning.

Manual checking breaks the moment volume rises.
Fatigue builds. Risk increases. 😮‍💨
One interruption is all it takes for the wrong item to be picked.

Pharmacies moving to Titan see the same shift:

• Manual checking drops from doing everything to about 20–30%
• Near misses fall from several each month to a couple a year
• Workflows scale from 4,000 to 17,000 items without chaos
• AI clears most routine clinical checks before anyone touches an item
• Barcode scanning enforces the exact item-to-patient match every time

This is enforced safety.
Not memory. Not vigilance.
A system that removes the bottleneck and keeps the line moving.
