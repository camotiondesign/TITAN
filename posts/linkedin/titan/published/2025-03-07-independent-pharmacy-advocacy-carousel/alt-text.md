## Slide 2 — Step 1: Find Your MP

**Alt text:**  
A minimalist slide titled "Step 1 — Find Your MP" in large blue text. Supporting text explains that your MP represents you and should hear your voice. A screenshot-style image of the UK Parliament website's "Find MPs" page is shown on the right, displaying a list of MPs with photos and names. An arrow points toward the image, and a note advises emailing both MPs if your pharmacy is in a different area from your home.

## Slide 3 — Step 2: Send Your Email

**Alt text:**  
A slide with the heading "Step 2 — Send Your Email" in blue. Text explains that MPs act when they see real stories from real people. On the right is a tilted image of an email document showing a drafted message about pharmacy funding pressures. Additional text instructs viewers to use the email template in the comments or write their own, and to explain how the funding crisis affects their pharmacy, staff, and patients.

## Slide 4 — Step 3: CC Key Ministers

**Alt text:**  
A slide titled "Step 3 — CC Key Ministers" with blue heading text. Supporting copy encourages maximising impact by copying in decision-makers. A checklist lists IPCN, the Health Secretary Wes Streeting, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves.

## Slide 5 — Why This Matters

**Alt text:**  
A slide with the heading "Why This Matters" in blue. Below, bullet points explain the consequences of inaction: more pharmacy closures, loss of vital patient care, pharmacy jobs at risk, and increased strain on the NHS. The tone is serious and urgent, ending with a bold statement urging immediate action before it is too late.

## Slide 6 — Take Action Today

**Alt text:**  
A concluding slide titled "Take Action Today" in large blue text. A checklist outlines three actions: find your MP, send your email, and demand action by copying MPs. Additional lines encourage sharing the message with other pharmacists and reposting to spread awareness. The design mirrors earlier slides with a clean gradient background and the TITAN logo at the bottom.
