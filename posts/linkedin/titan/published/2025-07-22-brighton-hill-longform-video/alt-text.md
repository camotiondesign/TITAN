# Transcript — Sagar Brighton Hill Longform Case Study Video

Meet Sagar, bit of a tech guy, and the owner of Brighton Hill Pharmacy in Basingstoke, where things run smoothly and never get chaotic.

So I'm Sagar Lungiwala. I'm the owner of Brighton Hill Pharmacy. This used to be ex-Boots. Been four years now owning this pharmacy, and I've significantly grown from 4000 items when I started to 17, 18,000 items now, which is fourfold increase in terms of items.

With the Titan PMR, it absolutely helps, because we can exactly track where the prescription is, what stage of the pharmacy it is, whether we have received the prescription or not, at what part of dispensing stage it is at, or whether it's ready for collection.

When in a busy hour of the pharmacy, I'm sure my team is all calm and collected. Most prescriptions are ready for same-day collection, provided the GP surgery sends us the prescription. It just flows.

Very easy to learn. On my day one of this current pharmacy, I was able to teach my team. The whole team was feeling comfortable in terms of dispensing the prescription.

Titan has played a big role in time leverage to run other services at the pharmacy. 80% of my time goes into the services.

In the morning, first thing I walk in I do the clinical checks. Probably around 10 or 11, I can then run the services without interrupting my dispensing flow.

We're using Repeat Flow to order the prescription for some of our Nomad patients. Titan Mobile always helps us quickly find the patient on the counter and send them a text as well.

Batch Flow is another big one. It really helps us streamline the dispensing process. We can do single patient mode or multi patient mode. Two different modes into Batch Flow which helps my team dispense the prescription.

Titan has changed the whole pharmacy workflow for me. I wouldn't even consider any other PMR. It has significantly helped to run the pharmacy smoothly.
