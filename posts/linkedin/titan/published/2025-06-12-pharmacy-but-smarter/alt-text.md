Flowchart illustrating Titan's prescription workflow. A prescription arrives automatically from the NHS Spine, then AI performs safety, dose, and interaction checks.

The dispenser prepares the prescription, the patient is notified via SMS with a QR code, and finally the patient collects their medication, completing the process.
