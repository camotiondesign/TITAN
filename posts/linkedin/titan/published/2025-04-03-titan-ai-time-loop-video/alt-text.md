Looping animated video comparing pharmacist time spent in the dispensary before and after Titan AI. A circular chart and percentage figures animate back and forth, showing "Before Titan AI" with 80% of the day spent in the dispensary, then transitioning to "After Titan AI" with only 20% of the day spent there, illustrating how automation reduces dispensing workload and frees time for other pharmacy services.
