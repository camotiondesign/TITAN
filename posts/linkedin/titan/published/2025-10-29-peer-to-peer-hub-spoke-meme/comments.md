With Titan's Peer to Peer function you can send prescriptions to any of your branches or to just one "hub" branch. This offers more flexibility in that you don't have to just have one hub branch. If you do have one hub branch, you now have business continuity so if anything goes wrong at the hub, you can send prescriptions to other branches and your operations are not stopped. #theTitanWay #hubandspoke
