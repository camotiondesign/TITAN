🚀 How Sagar 4x Pharmacy Items

and spends 80% of his time on services

✅ No chaos
✅ No overtime
✅ No dispensary firefighting

Just a calm, efficient system built right from the start.

When Sagar took over Brighton Hill Pharmacy, it was doing 4,000 items a month.
Now it's doing 17,000.

He didn't add staff. He added space. For clinics. For services. For growth.

Here's what made it possible:

💡 AI handles most clinical checks
📦 Every script is tracked from inbox to collection
📲 Patients get a text when it's ready
⏱️ Same-day turnaround is the norm

He spends one hour a day in the dispensary.
The rest goes into services: travel clinics, contraception, ear care, weight loss.

🧑⚕️ He even built a second consultation room.
Sagar isn't just scaling.
He's scaling with ease. He's leading by example.
