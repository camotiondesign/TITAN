“Only about 14–15% of items actually need a pharmacist check.”

So why is there still one sitting at the end of the bench checking everything?

That’s not workflow design.
That’s wasted clinical capacity.

Pharmacists trained for years.

Not just to check labels.
To care for patients.

Free them to do what they’re actually qualified for.
