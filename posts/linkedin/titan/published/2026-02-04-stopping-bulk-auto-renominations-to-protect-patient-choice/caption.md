Your patients chose you.

Then software quietly sent their prescriptions somewhere else.

Bulk auto-renomination tools scan for patients who’ve moved their scripts and switch them back.
No consent.
No notification.

Nothing’s there.
Carers do everything right.
Still left waiting.

Nearly 3,000 people have signed the petition calling for clear rules.
10,000 triggers a government response.
