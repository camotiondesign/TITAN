**Speaker 1 (Akbar):**  
Meet Akbar. I am the owner of Drayton Prime Pharmacy, and I'm a pharmacist as well.

**Speaker 2:**  
Also Exeter Community Pharmacy, Mount Pleasant Pharmacy, Somerby's Pharmacy, Gosport Community Pharmacy. And like he says…

**Speaker 1 (Akbar):**  
You've got to imagine — we are a 32,000-item pharmacy per month. That's four times more than most pharmacies, and yet day-to-day I'm not involved at all. Titan gives me that time. It allows me to focus on DJing.

**Speaker 2:**  
It's not just the system. This only works because of people like Maleeha.

**Speaker 3 (Maleeha):**  
I wouldn't say I run it. I'm just in the background making sure the work gets done. When things drop on Titan, it just automatically gets done — you're not waiting around so much.

**Speaker 1 (Akbar):**  
Prior to Titan, we had Proscripts Connect. Back then we used to print off scripts, print more scripts, print labels, and check — it was manic.

**Speaker 3 (Maleeha):**  
You don't need eyes in the back of your head like before. Because you've got an audit trail with Titan, you know exactly who did what and when.

**Speaker 1 (Akbar):**  
We finish everything. We clear the Owings. On Monday there might be 30. By the end of the week, there's nothing left.

**Speaker 3 (Maleeha):**  
I'm not glued to the screen all the time. Titan AI is doing around 70 percent of clinical checking. Our workload has reduced dramatically.

**Speaker 1 (Akbar):**  
When we were getting Titan we were either going to get a refit or get Titan. I chose Titan. I didn't need a refit because Titan saved a lot of time, effort and money. Before, we had more staff — I can comfortably say we've saved three or four roles. Before Titan we'd be there until 2am. A staff member once said: "This is hell." A month after Titan they said: "We can go home on time."

**Speaker 3 (Maleeha):**  
If I finish at 4.30, I go home at 4.30 — and I can still log into Titan from home.

**Speaker 1 (Akbar):**  
To all competitors in the area — don't get Titan. Stay paper based.

**Speaker 3 (Maleeha):**  
The pharmacy runs much smoother since moving to Titan. It's more efficient and more reliable.
