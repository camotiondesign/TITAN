As you can see, Titan has a comprehensive audit trail where we can see exactly when a prescription has been created, labelled, and handed out. For this test patient item, I can see the timestamp for when it was downloaded or created, when it was labelled, and when it was handed to the patient.

By clicking the item itself, I can see who clinically checked it, whether the label was scanned, and any manual entries. I can also see who completed each action. Previously on older systems, we signed the box to confirm dispensing — now we can instantly see who dispensed it and when it was handed out.

Following processes and protocols means we can guarantee that everything required has been handed to the patient. Without Titan this would be difficult to track.

It gives the team more independence — if full packs are ready and the item shows green, we can hand it out directly. This reduces pressure on the pharmacist while they are delivering services such as travel, and prevents long waits and frustrated patients.

Overall — fantastic.
