🚨 Pharmacies ranked #1 for healthcare access.

Meanwhile?

GPs were 640% more likely to be called "hard to reach."

New YouGov data confirms what pharmacy teams already know: They show up — when others can't.

Let's break it down:

• Just 5% said pharmacies were hard to access

• For GPs? 37% — the worst of any setting

• Pharmacies ranked #1 overall — ahead of GPs, dentists, A&E and hospitals

• And when patients couldn't get a GP appointment, most said it harmed their health

Despite rising pressure, pharmacies stayed open, trusted, and accessible. And the public noticed:

• 77% would be concerned if their pharmacy closed

• 65% said pharmacies are personally important

• Most now want pharmacies to do even more clinical care

📌 Pharmacies aren't a fallback. They're the front door to the NHS.
