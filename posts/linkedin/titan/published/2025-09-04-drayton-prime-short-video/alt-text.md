**Akbar Aslam:**  
At the time we were getting Titan, we were either going to get a refit or get Titan. 

I went with Titan, and I didn't need a refit because Titan saved a lot of time, effort and money.

Before, we used to have a lot more staff members. I can comfortably say we've saved three or four roles.

Before Titan, we'd be there until two in the morning. A staff member once looked at me and said:

"This is hell."

A month after we got Titan, they said:

"We can go home on time."

If I finish at 4.30, I go home at 4.30.
