We were on our third site really encouraged by the progress that we've made with the other two. We had the Easter period where we've, we've probably lost about 50 hours of staff per week, and we had three bank holidays in quick succession, and we're doing a 10,000 item pharmacy, and we didn't, didn't hit a road bump. It literally went as smooth as ever has been. And the staff put that down to Titan. And the introduction of Batch Flow has made a huge difference. Being able to get all the 1-2-3 item scripts and get them done with just a couple of trips around the dispensary. You can dispense a couple of 100 items with one member of staff in a morning, and it's really, really productive. This is about week three for Kyneton. Done quite a lot of prepping. We had Titan running alongside their previous PMR so that the staff could spend some time watching the onboarding videos. They all had a go at dispensing some prescriptions using the packaging feature with the clean items, and so they all had a little bit of an exposure before we decided to switch over nominations. And we switched over nominations about two weeks ago, and everything's nice and stable at the moment, which is really good. The teams still need to get a lot more experience, a lot more confidence. I think having NMS in today has been really good, because I've got two experienced Titan users who benefited from training to really kind of stretch their knowledge and bring them up to date. The prep is really important because it means that you get better value for money out of your training day. You don't want to have your trainer come in and hold hands on the basic functions. Learning to use Titan at a basic level is like learning to use a Sainsbury's self checkout. It's really intuitive. Use the onboarding videos get experienced staff in just to do the simple stuff. What you're really looking for from your trainer is to take people from knowing Titan at 70% to taking them to 95% that's where the trainer comes in. So.
