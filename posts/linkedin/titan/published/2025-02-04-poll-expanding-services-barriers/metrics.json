  "notes": "Organic post. Poll results reveal time & staffing shortages (47%) as primary barrier to service expansion, validating messaging around time-saving and efficiency benefits. Limited participation (15 votes) suggests polls may need more active promotion. Results influence future content strategy toward service enablement messaging."
