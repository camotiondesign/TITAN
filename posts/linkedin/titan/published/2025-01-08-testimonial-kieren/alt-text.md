# Short Clip Transcript – Kieren Testimonial

"Titan's been a real game changer for me. Before I was using Titan, I was working two or three nights a week late. I was stressed, burnt out. I just didn't have the capacity to do it. It's just freed up so much time. Now I get home every night. I even work from home several days a week, because I can access all my systems from home. Our services are increased. Our NMSS have gone from 30 to 180 a month. My staff, my patients, are all happier. Patients get the text messages as soon as it goes on the shelf and nothing's missed, it's just changed. Everything. Get ready to hand your notice in."
