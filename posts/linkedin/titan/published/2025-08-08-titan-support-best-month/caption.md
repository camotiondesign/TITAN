Last month was our best month ever for support.

Here's what the data says:

100% SLA adherence.

98% resolution rate.

And no — that didn't happen by accident.

We've always said:

A great PMR isn't just about features.

It's about backing you when it matters most.

That's why we train our support staff in real pharmacies.

They batch. They label. They feel the pace.

Because if you don't understand pharmacy, you can't support it.

Built by pharmacy.

Backed by pharmacy.

And last month — the numbers proved it.

Shoutout to Molly and the whole support team for setting the bar.

You don't just fix problems.

You get it.
