With TITAN PMR's Peer 2 Peer (hub and spoke) functionality, the whole pharmacy team — not just the pharmacists — is freed up to focus on patient-facing services.

Well done Jeet Vadodaria and Titan.  

For clarity — doing Hub & Spoke before the law change has only been permitted when all branches operate under the same legal entity. Many independents are not structured that way, which is why this legislation is a genuine game-changer.  

Groups trading as multiple entities can, from Oct 1st, choose to build their own hub (if they want to invest in staffing and automation and their geography supports it), **or** plug into a pay-as-you-go 3rd-party provider covering branches anywhere in England.  

Different models will suit different pharmacy businesses.

Well said — but it shows #Independents don't need to rely on 3rd-party suppliers when you can do it yourself 👍🏽
