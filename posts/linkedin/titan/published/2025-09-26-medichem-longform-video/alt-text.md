**Speaker 1 (VO):**  
Meet Jeet. Truth is, he runs his pharmacy in a very different way. We started in 2021.

**Speaker 2 (Jeet Vadodaria):**  
We've now got four under our belt. We'd probably be hitting about 40,000 items. And I had to make a decision — how are we going to be more efficient so that we're more profitable as a business?

**Speaker 1 (VO):**  
The idea was simple — move dispensing out of the branches, free them up to focus on care.

**Speaker 2 (Jeet Vadodaria):**  
And this is where the creation of the hub came in. The pharmacists in the branch do their own clinical checks. The dispensers decide which prescriptions can be hubbed, then they send it to the hub, it comes back packaged and ready for patients to collect. It frees the team to do everything else but dispensing.

And the results — they speak for themselves.

Using the Power BI data analysis that Titan gives you, they were doing around 12–15 items an hour. Now it's between 40–45 items an hour. The same dispenser who worked in branch is four times more efficient. We've reduced about 45% of stock holding capacity at branch level using peer to peer and stock control. We're not overstocked — any excess is used appropriately across branches. With peer to peer functionality, if you're part of the same group, you can technically send prescriptions to any branch and have them dispense for you — and soon, once legislation changes in October — it could be other branches as well.

**Speaker 1 (VO):**  
This isn't just a new business model — it's building a more resilient community of pharmacies.

**Speaker 2 (Jeet Vadodaria):**  
If you're thinking about getting Titan, and planning for hub and spoke — get it. The numbers speak for themselves. If you want your dispensers to be four times more efficient — then that's the route you take.
