One pharmacist at head office.

All consultations visible to senior management.

Control across 12 branches.

That's what early adopters built with Titanverse.

NMS was the first live module. It meant we could centralise everything at head office. Only one pharmacist needed to complete them, but it was visible to all senior management.

That's the operational advantage.

Centralized service delivery.  
Full visibility.  
Complete control.

No matter how many locations you run.
