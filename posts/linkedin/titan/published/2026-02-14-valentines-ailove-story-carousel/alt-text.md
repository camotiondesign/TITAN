## Design Brief (from Notion)

7-slide carousel — ROMANTIC MOVIE POSTER PARODIES

CONCEPT: Each slide is a fake romantic movie poster, parodying a famous romance film with pharmacy/AI taglines. Bold cinematic typography, warm golden/rose colour grade throughout. Illustrated silhouette figures or stylised pharmacy scenes — NOT actual movie stills. Consistent layout across all slides: movie title top, tagline centre/bottom, subtle romantic poster framing (lens flare, dramatic lighting, etc.)

Slide 1: HOOK — Generic rom-com poster style
Title: "Me & AI: A Pharmacy Love Story"
Tagline: "This Valentine's Day… one pharmacist found the one."
Visual: Silhouette of pharmacist gazing at a glowing screen. Warm golden tones, cinematic lens flare.

Slide 2: "The Notebook" parody
Title: "The Logbook"
Tagline: "She checked every script by hand. Until AI said… I'll do it."
Visual: Two silhouettes in dramatic embrace pose — one holding a prescription bag. Rain optional.

Slide 3: "Titanic" parody
Title: "Titan-ic"
Tagline: "I'll never let go… of your repeat prescriptions."
Visual: Iconic bow-of-the-ship pose but with pharmacy props. Could be a pharmacist with arms spread in front of a glowing Titan screen.

Slide 4: "Crazy, Stupid, Love" parody
Title: "Crazy, Stupid, Workflow"
Tagline: "You had me at 'batch complete'."
Visual: Two figures across a pharmacy counter, romantic tension. One leaning on the counter, the other mid-dispensing.

Slide 5: "10 Things I Hate About You" parody
Title: "10 Things I Hate About My Old PMR"
Tagline: "Paper trails. Chasing. Late finishes. But then I met Titan."
Visual: Pharmacist tearing up a paper prescription list, confetti-style. Dramatic backlight.

Slide 6: "Love Actually" parody
Title: "Cleared Actually"
Tagline: "Friday 5pm. No baskets. No backlog. It's actually happening."
Visual: Pharmacist walking out the door into golden sunset light. Coat on. Bag packed. Pure freedom energy.

Slide 7: END CARD — "THE REVIEWS ARE IN" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Styled like movie critic review quotes / Rotten Tomatoes style.
Warm cinematic background continues. Three real customer quotes styled as movie reviews with star ratings and first names:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Thanks to Titan PMR, I'm probably still in community pharmacy. Otherwise I would have left a long time ago." — Prab

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Since the time we've had Titan, I think I've managed to become a dad as well." — Jeet

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "It's like a second pair of eyes." — Malia

Layout: Stack the three quotes vertically like pull-quote review cards. Each quote in italics with the customer name right-aligned beneath. Star ratings above each quote. Titan PMR logo + titanpmr.com at the bottom.

Optional: Add a "NOW SHOWING AT A PHARMACY NEAR YOU" line above the quotes to keep the movie theme alive.

DESIGN NOTES:
- Consistent warm golden/rose colour grade across all slides
- Bold cinematic serif typography for titles (think movie poster fonts)
- Taglines in lighter weight beneath
- Illustrated/silhouette style — NOT photographic, NOT stock photos
- Each slide must work as a standalone image if shared individually
- Keep text readable at mobile size
- Titan PMR logo subtle on slides 1-6, prominent on slide 7
- Slide 7 review quotes should feel like genuine movie critic pull-quotes — use quotation marks, italic text, and clean spacing

TONE: Funny, warm, self-aware. Every joke is a real Titan AI benefit in disguise. Product education wrapped in entertainment. Final slide grounds the humour in real customer proof.
