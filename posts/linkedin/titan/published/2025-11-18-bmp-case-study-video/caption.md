170,000 items a month sounds impressive.

Yusuf knew BMP HEALTHCARE LTD could not keep absorbing that pressure.

Too much checking. Too much noise. Too many days shaped by the bench.

Then he saw Titan at the Pharmacy Show in 2023.

Checks fell to around 20 to 30 percent.

Services grew by hundreds of percent.

What changed.

What surprised him.

And why he will not go back.
