The role of the dispensary will be not gone, but it will be considerably less. Now, today, when I have done sort of circa 50 flu jabs today — that's not loads, but there would still be, at four o'clock or five o'clock when there's no more flu jabs, piles and piles of baskets waiting for me to check. That's not the case today, even on our first day. It's just gone on smooth in a way that it couldn't have done before. I'm quite hopeful that my role is going to change completely and it will allow me to be in here rather than dispensing.
