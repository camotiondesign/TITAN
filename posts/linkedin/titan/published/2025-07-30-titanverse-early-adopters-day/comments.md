After a couple days of use, I can already see that this is going to make a bigger impact than titan PMR itself did. It has the ability to really leverage value from our time and focus on a seamless process in our private services. I am looking forward to the evolving journey with titanverse. The use of innovative tech to streamline processes and give a unrivalled experience to patients is exactly what the sector needs to allow it to finally take its rightful place at the heart of healthcare.

Now if only the NHS can similarly step up to deliver on its tech promises.

Either way, we are on the cusp of further transformational change in the sector.

I look forward to the usual scramble of other providers, now trying to be "like titanverse"... 😆 TITAN PMR IPCN - Independent Pharmacy Contractors Network Wahid Muhammad Sajid Ramzan Tariq Muhammad Hooman Ghalamkari Jeff Shelley Charis Stacey …more
