# Short Clip Transcript – Faz & Nav Demonstration

**Faz:**  
Would we recommend Titan fast, 100% Nav, but don't just take my word for it. Let me show you a demonstration. Let's go.

**Narration/Demonstration:**  
Titan increases the overall efficiency for pharmacies. Once the clinical check has been done, prescriptions can be picked, scanned, labeled, and bagged. If the items go green, pharmacists really only need to check the control drugs and split packs. They can get on with other services.

The Edo device allows for a paperless audit trail to be left so that all staff know where all items are at all times.

Extra features such as repeat flow for patient requests and batch flow for safe dispensing of multiple prescriptions is also available, keeping all patients and staff happy.

**Faz:**  
So now, would you recommend Titan? 100%.

So what are you waiting for? Get it today. Do.
