We caught up with Zeinab from PillSorted at The Pharmacy Show 2025 💬

After 20 years in pharmacy, she's seen how one small detail can protect or endanger a patient.

Her message was simple:

Barcodes save lives.

If a barcode is reused or wrong, it can lead to dangerous dispensing errors.

That's why Pillsorted is campaigning to make barcodes mandatory for every MHRA medicine application, and why Titan shares that same focus on accuracy and patient safety.

Two teams. One goal.

Zero errors reaching the patient.
