Even if you don't know anything about pharmacy, this is worth listening to.

One to listen to for all Pharmacists – it's time to pivot, release the shackles and grow our clinical offering for our communities above and beyond the NHS contract.  

Well done TITAN PMR for leading the way and shaking the system!
