This is a talk worth listening to if you work in pharmacy 👇

At The Pharmacy Show 2025, we spoke to many people.

The message was clear:

💬 Pharmacy can't survive by doing what it's always done.

Across every conversation, one theme stood out.

The old model isn't working anymore.

Margins are shrinking.

Promises keep shifting.

And independents are left trying to hold it all together.

When Tariq Muhammad took the stage, he said what many were already thinking:

"Dispensing alone is no longer viable."

It's time to rebuild pharmacy for more than survival.

✅ A future where independent owners lead

✅ Private services that drive profit and impact

✅ Technology that creates freedom and control

That's the future TITAN PMR and TITANVERSE were built for.
