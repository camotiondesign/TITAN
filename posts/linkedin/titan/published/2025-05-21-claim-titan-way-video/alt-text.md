Motion-graphics style video showing how pharmacy claiming time is reduced using Titan. The video opens with an animated clock and text explaining that claiming used to consume the day. A smooth transition turns a graphic stroke into a button, followed by a cursor clicking it with the words "one click." Particles are pulled into the button, which transforms into a glowing 3D orb representing claims being processed instantly. The orb floats downward as text appears saying the time has been given back, before drifting away into closing text reading "Claim. The Titan Way," with all text and elements smoothly animated throughout.
