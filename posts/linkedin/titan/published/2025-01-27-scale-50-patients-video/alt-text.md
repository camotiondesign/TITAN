# Short Clip Transcript – Cameron Testimonial

"So like going from a knock your 402 to when the first Aqua iPhone came up, that's how intuitive charging is. Very easy. Picking stock, literally pick you up to 50 patients in one go, push your a four sheet gives you like 50 patients medication. So if I'm going to the shelf to pick something, I'll only go to that shelf once for all 50 patients. I won't be picking, for example, 15 umbrella teams separately, back and forth. Back and forth frees up so much stuff time. Well, you can scale your dispensing so you can increase your dispensing quite smoothly without increasing man hours any of the PMR systems. And it's my honest opinion, if you're a pharmacy owner or a manager, get out your contracts quickly, plan and switch you tighten, it's going to make your life so much easier."
