# Video transcript — Customer testimonial (2025-05-10)

A lot of processes pharmacies don't have time to do that are part of their compliance process, and this will free up your time to do that as well as provide services without being stressed and overworked. But we can already see how it's going to save us an immense amount of time, not just me, but the dispensary staff, to be able to get processes done quicker. Prescriptions ready for staff quicker. Which means we're happy. Patients are happy. But most importantly, free up time to do services and training of staff to get them to potentially do services, be able to provide a whole round service, which obviously, for a pharmacy point of view, we are a business. It will increase revenue if you're able to get yourself on board with Titan and I think it's the future of working for pharmacy. In my opinion.
