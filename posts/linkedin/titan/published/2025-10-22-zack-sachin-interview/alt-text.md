Titan. What originally made you come to Titan?

**Sachin:**  
I was very frustrated with other PMR systems.

**Zack:**  
And how have you been finding it so far?

**Sachin:**  
Very efficient. I really love that barcode validation. I really love the dispensing process has been split down into individual processes.

**Zack:**  
How do you feel that the progress has been through the years?

**Sachin:**  
Where do I start? Yeah. So it started that they listen to their customers, and they add features that are very important to us, like making ordering simple, ordering at clinical track, ordering at download of the prescription. We never saw that with any other PMR system, yeah.

**Zack:**  
So definitely taking on customer concerns and really implementing those changes into Titan?

**Sachin:**  
Yes.

**Zack:**  
So if you could sum up Titan in one word, what would it be?

**Sachin:**  
Paperless?

**Zack:**  
Great. Thank you so much.

**Sachin:**  
Sachin, thank you.

**Zack:**  
Thank you.
