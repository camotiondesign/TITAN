"That's the classic line right there from Prabjaudt Channa

"5 years ago I'd be stuck in the dispensary stressed out and buried in baskets"

If this sounds familiar 👉🏼 Baskets piled up, the Pharmacist head always looking down with no time at all to talk and a good 'Pen' for scribbling your signature on the labels 🙈 then you're haemorrhaging business money 💷

Turn the old skool thought process into a new and better way of working. Work smart, not hard.

Is it time you made that change!

Prabjaudt Channa did and look at him now 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💪🏼🫶🏼

TITAN PMR 👌

P.S. Is there now a robot in there 🤖? Mmmmm…..I think Balal Anwar has been here 😉🤣

Meditech UK ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
