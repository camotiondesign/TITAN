One of the biggest waste of time is trying to find a prescription when a patient comes in. Unless its baged up and on the correct collection shelf, it will take ages searching through hundreds of baskets. With TITAN'S workflow that tracks each stage of the dispensing journey, you can pinpoint exactly where a prescription is.
