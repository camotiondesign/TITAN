"We don't miss the old PMR."

That's what Sharne told us on her first day with Titan.

Wellesbourne Pharmacy had just switched from Cegedim.

What stood out immediately?

✅ Safer checks with Titan AI
✅ Speed from Quick Packaging and Quick Check
✅ A team that felt clear, capable and in control

Naz from Titan was on site. The new workflow just made sense.

Amanda put it simply:
"𝘐 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘪𝘵. 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘢𝘴 𝘦𝘹𝘤𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵."

Real team. Real feedback.
All from day one.
