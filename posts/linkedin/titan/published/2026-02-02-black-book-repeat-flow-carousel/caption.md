There’s someone in every pharmacy with a black book.

Patient names. Repeat patterns. Tricky meds.
All in there somewhere. Or sometimes just in their head.

When they're off? Chaos.
Orders get missed. Surgeries get chased twice. Or not at all.

Even when they're in, every pharmacy runs the same loop:
Order. Wait. Chase. Reconcile. File. Repeat.

The problem isn't the person. It's that the system relies on them.

Titan Repeat Flow changes that:
🔄 Auto-ordering at inbox
📦 Auto-reconciliation on receipt
📞 Automatic chasing
📱 PharmAppy for patient self-service

Scrap the black book.
