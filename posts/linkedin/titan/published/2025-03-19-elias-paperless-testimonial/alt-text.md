## Video Description

A testimonial-style video featuring a pharmacist speaking inside their pharmacy about using Titan PMR to move toward a fully paperless workflow. The pharmacist explains how dispensing no longer relies on constant pharmacist intervention, allowing the wider team to work confidently and independently. They describe benefits such as digital, trackable prescriptions, double barcode validation, and reduced clutter in the dispensary. The video focuses on freeing up time for services, empowering the team, and choosing a forward-thinking system that supports a more efficient, modern pharmacy.
