It's not learning from Google.

In the UK, we use NICE.  
We use the Green Book.

A closed system, fed only with the right clinical information.

One thing early adopters made clear: the AI needed to be learning from the correct resources.

When it comes to travel vaccinations, it can't just be learning from Google. It's got to be learning from reliable resources in the UK.

The team at Titan have done a brilliant job making sure it's a closed system, fed only with the right clinical information.

That's how you build trust.

That's how you ensure safety.
