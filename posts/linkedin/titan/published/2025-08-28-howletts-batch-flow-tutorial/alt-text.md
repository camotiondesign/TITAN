At the moment I'm doing a bit of batch dispensing because it allows me to dispense about fifteen baskets at a time.  

Each basket has a number and a name attached to it and prints a sheet as well.

This QR code shows I've got fourteen baskets. It allows me to randomly pick all the items — I don't need to do it in order.  

It tells me which basket each item belongs to, so we label it and in it goes.  

Titan generates the pick list and everything for me. I'm just popping items into the right basket.

It's easier because I can bag everything myself — I'm not waiting for the pharmacist.  

If a patient is waiting and I know everything is ready, as long as I follow SOPs and scan every item individually — even if there are two, I still scan both.

Green means ready to close.  

Red means something needs attention — might be a split, or something needing a check.

If I try to package a split pack Titan blocks it and sends it to the pharmacist side automatically.  

That means fewer baskets for her to check, which frees up our diary for more services.

I've just completed about fifteen baskets — doing single baskets and back-and-forth takes much longer.  

With batch flow I'm faster because I collect all the dispensing items in one go.

Titan recognises fridge items and prints the label for me.  

We assign fridge, delivery and bulky item QR codes to store correctly.

When the patient arrives and their name is entered, the system shows instantly that their item is in the fridge — assigned and ready.
