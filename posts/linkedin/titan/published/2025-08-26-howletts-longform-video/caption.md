If dispensing still eats every hour of your day…

what happens to your services, your patients, your future?

That's the question Pritee asked herself at Howletts Pharmacy in Ruislip.

Before Titan, she was buried in baskets. Accuracy checks stacked high. End-of-month claims dragging into days. Services struggling to take off.

Now?

Her team runs calmly and confidently:

• 6,500 items a month
• 50–60% prescriptions AI-checked
• 20–30% faster dispensing with Batch Flow

That freed up space for real growth:

✔ 60–70 BP checks a month (up from 10–15)
✔ 18 active weight management clients
✔ 2–3 private consultations every day

And for Pritee, the most important shift is cultural:

"Technology is wonderful, but it can't replace people. Titan frees my staff up to be there for the community — and that's what matters most."

This is what calm, digital-first pharmacy looks like.
