Will Titan be at the The Pharmacy Show this year?

Hmm, let us think.

It's the biggest gathering of the pharmacy community.

Crowds. Conversations. Ideas. Innovation.

A chance to connect, to learn, to look forward together.

👉 Of course we will.

And this year, we're bringing:

⚡ Titan + Titanverse live in action

⚡ New ways to scale dispensing smarter

⚡ More reasons to believe pharmacy can thrive

📍 12–13 October, NEC Birmingham

👀 See you there.
