You know, it's like a pick a mix shop here. Pick who you want, talk to them, or if not, they'll end up picking you.

There is no comparison with Titan. Titan is the king. You need to have the best system, sufficient system, and get feedback from your customers in terms of what's not working. And I feel that Titan definitely does that. Yes, I'm looking forward for Titanverse.

**Speaker 3 (0:24)**  
I've literally just arrived. Right now, there's so many people buzzing over Titan. I haven't even had a chance to have a demo just yet. I mean—

**Speaker 1 (0:31)**  
It looks like we're the only busier stand here. To be fair, I can't even get on my own stand.

**Speaker 4 (0:35)**  
Titan's fantastic. Really responsive team. I know it's innovative — so that's what we like to see.

**Speaker 3 (0:41)**  
You're a lovely lot. You've got an amazing stall. I'm really looking forward to working with you — when you show me something.

**Speaker 1 (0:47)**  
Follow me then. Itemistic business relationship manager villain.

**Speaker 2 (0:51)**  
Innovation meets automation. That's Titan and Meditech.

**Speaker 5 (0:55)**  
Yeah, it's always good. I don't care about other PMR providers. Come on. You haven't even got to know Titan. Through and through now. Team Titan — that's it, amazing.

**Speaker 1 (1:07)**  
Let me get you on this one. All the stands are so busy, sir. I mean, tell me — what do you think of Titan?

**Speaker 2 (1:17)**  
I currently have PharmaDoctor, I have ECG feature, I have Q-flow — I think there's five different systems Titanverse would combine. It's not just that we see them here. Titan — from the peers that I work with who use Titan — have said it's the best software brewing.  

I came to the Pharmacy Show last year. After two minutes, I was sold. And just the way the system works now, after having the system for four months — it's brilliant. Operationally for us, the efficiency is there, and it's time-saving, as you can see.

**Speaker 1 (1:49)**  
I mean, look around the stand. I'm not even on the stand — I can't even get on our own stand. Amazing. Good vibes. Lovely to meet existing people. Lovely to meet new people. And so, yeah, see you next year!
