Some pharmacies might walk away from Pharmacy First

And it's not hard to see why

New rules mean if you don't hit 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺 target, you lose up to £1,000/month

That includes:
✔ Minor illness consultations
✔ Contraception services
✔ Hypertension checks
⚠️ And soon: 1 ABPM per month

The problem?
Only 30% of pharmacies currently meet the full bundle
ABPM is slow, low demand, and hard to convert in a walk-in model
Miss it—and you lose everything

No flexibility
No partial credit
No margin for real-world pharmacy

This is how NHS dentistry broke
And pharmacy could be next

With pressures this high, more owners are asking:
Should we be focusing on private services instead?

What needs to change before October?
The targets? The model? Or the direction altogether?
