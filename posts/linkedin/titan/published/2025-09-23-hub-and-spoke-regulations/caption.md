Your pharmacy's workflow could change forever.

From 1 Oct 2025, independents can use hubs across ownership lines.

Here's what owners need to know:

1️⃣ Law in force: 1 Oct 2025

2️⃣ Notify your ICB: at least 28 days before you begin

3️⃣ Earliest start: If you notify on 1 Oct and there's no objection → 29 Oct 2025

Before you begin, check off:

• ✔ Hub due diligence

• ✔ SOPs

• ✔ Courier SLAs

• ✔ Business continuity

• ✔ Data sharing

• ✔ Audit trail

Bottom line:

Plan now. Patient safety and business resilience come first.
