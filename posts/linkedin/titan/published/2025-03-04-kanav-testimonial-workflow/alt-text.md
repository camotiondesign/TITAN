You seem to be pretty relaxed. How do you have so much time? Titans helping me a lot with my dispensing so on daily basis, the way we work, I'm only doing my clinical checks, and I leave the rest for my dispensing team to dispense it, bag it, file it and hand it out. Meanwhile, I do all my other services in the consultation room, such as air Vax removal, travel, health, weight loss, and all the other sorts. And all because of Titan,

the last pharmacy I worked at, used to claim prescriptions all day long and get behind dispensing. But I don't do claim in here. Why is that?

**Speaker 1 (0:35)**  
Well, partially, a lot of other pharmacies, they have a lot of different softwares, but through Titan, all you do is you click on one claim, and it claims all the descriptions for the day. So then that means you're free to do dispensing. You're free to do all the other things Kaya, and you can get on with all the other customer services and all the other services that we provide in our store.
