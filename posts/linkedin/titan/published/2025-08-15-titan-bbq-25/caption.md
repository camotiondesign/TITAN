Sunshine. Laughter. Basically a school sports day.

Titan BBQ 25 had it all.

Once a year, we get the whole Titan crew together for BBQ 25. A day to swap the laptops for laughter, the deadlines for a bit of good-natured rivalry, and remember what it is like to be properly outside.

🥥 Coconut shy
⚽ Football speed tests
💪 Tug of war
🏃 Sack races (with some questionable technique)
🍔 And food worth queueing twice for

It had all the magic of being back on the school field, just with fewer grazed knees and much better catering.

Thank you to every single one of you for bringing the energy, the humour and the team spirit that made BBQ 25 what it was. You turned it into more than just a day out, you made it a day to remember.

Here is to BBQ 26. Same time next year. Same team.
