#AskYourPharmacist Week 2025

Pharmacies do more than people think.

This week celebrates the incredible role of community pharmacy in delivering NHS services close to home.

From blood pressure checks and contraception consultations to vaccinations and everyday health advice, pharmacy teams across the UK help patients access care faster, safer and closer than ever before.

You might be surprised by how much your local pharmacy already does, and how much more it is ready to do.

💙 Care you can trust. Right at your doorstep.
