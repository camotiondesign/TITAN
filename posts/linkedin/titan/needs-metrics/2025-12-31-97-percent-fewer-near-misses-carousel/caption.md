Safy's Chemist on Melton Road has served its community for 45 years. Today, it's one of the busiest pharmacies in the area, dispensing 14,500 items every month.

A year ago, the pharmacy was averaging 5-6 near misses per month. Pharmacist Asif was spending his entire nine-hour day checking prescriptions, running back and forth between the consultation room and dispensary. Baskets piling up. Constant worry about patient safety.

Since switching to Titan, near misses have dropped to just 2 in an entire year.

The improvement is so significant that Asif jokes about inspector skepticism: "I'm worried the inspector is going to come in, look at my near misses, and say, 'You can't have only made two mistakes in a year.'"

This doesn't happen by asking people to be more careful. It happens when safety is designed into the workflow—when barcode scanning prevents wrong products from reaching patients, when the system won't let staff seal a bag if items are missing, when every item is tracked with batch numbers and expiry dates.

The numbers tell the story. But the real story is what changed: from constant worry to calm control, from chaos to confidence.
