From 5–6 near misses a month
to 2 in an entire year.

From constant worry
to calm control.

That doesn't happen by asking people to be more careful.
It happens when safety is designed into the workflow.

Asif runs a pharmacy dispensing 14,500 items a month.
Before the system changed, he was constantly moving.
Back and forth. Checking between appointments. Baskets piling up.

Today, around 85% of his time is freed up.
Not because he works faster, but because the work flows differently.

This video is Asif explaining what actually changed,
what surprised him,
and why he wouldn't go back.
