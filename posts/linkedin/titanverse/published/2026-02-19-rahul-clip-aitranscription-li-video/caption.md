Scraps of paper.

That’s how Rahul used to take clinical notes.

Sat with a patient.
Typing. Not looking at them.
Or scribbling something down he’d never read again.

💬 “Note-taking was pretty poor.”

Here’s what changed.

Titanverse records the full consultation.
Transcribes it. Structures it. Stores it. All compliant.

Rahul doesn’t type anymore.
Doesn’t scribble.

He looks at the patient.
And actually has the conversation.

⏱️ 10–20 minutes saved per patient.

That’s not just a feature.
That’s a different way of working.
