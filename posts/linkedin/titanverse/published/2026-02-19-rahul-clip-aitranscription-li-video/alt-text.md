# TV_RahulClip_AITranscription_LI – Alt Text

## Design Brief (from Notion)

Short video clip (30-50 seconds) of Rahul speaking about AI transcription. Key moments to use:

1. Opening hook: "Writing notes would've been on scraps of paper" (0:00-0:05)
2. The problem: typing vs looking at the patient (0:05-0:12)
3. The reveal: "I can't believe AI transcription wasn't a thing in pharmacy" (0:12-0:18)
4. The result: maintaining eye contact, building rapport, everything compliant (0:32-0:45)

Edit style: Talking head with subtle lower-third name/title. Cut between tight and medium shots. Add text overlay for the key stat '10-20 minutes saved per patient'. Use Titanverse pink-purple gradient accent on any text elements. Clean, cinematic feel. No heavy graphics over Rahul speaking.
