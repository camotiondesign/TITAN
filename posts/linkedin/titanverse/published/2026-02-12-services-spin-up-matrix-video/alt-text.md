# TV_ServicesSpinUp_Matrix – Alt Text

## Design Brief (from Notion)

ANIMATED MATRIX — Semrush-inspired grid format (see reference screenshots)

Single looping animation that cycles through three states. As the active tab changes, the corresponding tiles highlight in teal.

---

LAYOUT (consistent throughout):
- Header: large text — "One service. Five services. Full clinical model."
- Subheader: "Same platform. Different starting points."
- Three tabs across top: [Single Service] | [Multi-Service] | [Full Clinical Model]
- Grid of capability tiles below (4 columns x 4 rows):
  Row 1: Booking | Consultations | AI Scribe | Payments
  Row 2: NMS Workflow | Follow-Ups | Compliance | Reporting
  Row 3: Prescribing | Travel Health | Central Control | PharmAppy Integration
  Row 4: Staff Management | Patient Comms | Clinical Pathways | Multi-Site View
- Titanverse logo bottom right, titanverse.co.uk bottom left

ANIMATION NOTES:
- Loop: State 1 → State 2 → State 3 → pause → restart
- Each state holds for ~2-3 seconds
- Tiles transition smoothly (fade or colour shift, not instant snap)
- Tab indicator shifts cleanly between states
- Total loop: ~8-10 seconds

DESIGN NOTES:
- Dark background (#0d0d1a or similar)
- Teal highlight: Titanverse brand teal
- Grey tiles: #2a2a3a with white text
- Clean, modern grid — rounded corners on tiles
- Reference: Semrush SEO/AEO matrix post (screenshots provided)
- Keep tiles compact — 2-3 words max per tile
- No icons needed, text-only tiles work best for this formata
