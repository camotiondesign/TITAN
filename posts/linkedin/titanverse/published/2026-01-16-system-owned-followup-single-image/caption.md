Care doesn't fall down in the consultation 💬

It falls down in the follow-up.

When the system doesn't own continuity, it defaults to notes, reminders and memory.
That's fragmented. That's fragile.

As services scale, overlap increases.
Ownership blurs.
And the mental load lands on the pharmacist 🧠

Follow-up shouldn't rely on recollection.
It should be enforced by design.

System owned pathways.
Clear tasks.
Automatic closure.

That's how continuity scales, every time, for every patient.
