A split-screen Titanverse graphic comparing two approaches to follow-up. On the left, a grey scene shows a pharmacist at a desk surrounded by scattered icons representing notes, reminders, and thought bubbles, labelled "Fragmented Follow-up." On the right, a purple-lit scene shows a pharmacist at a modern desk with interconnected task and pathway icons above them, labelled "System-Owned Follow-up." Titanverse branding appears at the bottom.
