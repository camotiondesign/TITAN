## Alt Text (Overview)

A fast-paced Titanverse promotional video set against a dark, star-filled background with glowing purple accents. The opening frames show a pharmacist avatar above bold text reading "Pharmacy Services," surrounded by animated UI panels for reports, consultations, prescribing, payments, and communication. The video then expands to reveal a grid of service modules including AI triage, Pharmacy First, calendars, QR codes, AI notetaker, and live availability. Additional panels animate into view, highlighting pharmacist-specific tools and a "More +" button. Midway through, swirling radial rings display features such as SMS, CRM, AI templates, referral letters, SOAP notes, and security badges like ISO 27001 and Cyber Essentials. The video ends with a glowing Titanverse logo fading forward from the centre of the screen.
