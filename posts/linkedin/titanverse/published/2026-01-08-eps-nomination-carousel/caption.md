EPS nomination underpins patient choice and continuity.

The Electronic Prescription Service is one of the most advanced systems in the world.

It has transformed how prescriptions move between GP practices, pharmacies, and patients. ⚙️

But there is a design flaw.

Nomination can currently be changed:
• at scale 📈
• automatically 🤖
• without a fresh, explicit patient decision ❌

That bypasses informed consent.

When nomination is unstable or opaque, care pathways become unpredictable.
Follow-ups fragment.
Responsibility blurs.

This is not a technical edge case.
It is a system design and consent issue 🧩

This isn't about opposing EPS.
It's about protecting what makes it work:
patient choice 🧍‍♂️
transparency 🔍
and trust 🤝
