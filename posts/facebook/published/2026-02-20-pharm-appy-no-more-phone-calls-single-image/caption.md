How Priory Pharmacy handles "Is my prescription ready?"

They don't.

📱 Patient requests medication on the app
📥 It drops directly into Titan
📊 As each item progresses — Ordered, Preparing, Ready
🔔 They get a push notification

No phone calls.
No chasing.
No "let me check for you."

The system updates the patient. Not the team.

Titan + PharmAppy. Built for pharmacies that want their phones to stop ringing.
