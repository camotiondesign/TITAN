Pharmacy used to be simple.

Open near a GP. Dispense. Survive.

That model didn't vanish overnight.
It's being squeezed month by month 📉

The business model has changed.
The workflows haven't.

Dispensing margin is no longer a growth strategy.

It's a holding pattern. Busy, stable, and slowly running out of options ⏳

And holding patterns end the same way.
No headroom. No investment. No resilience.

The pharmacies that survive won't be the ones that work harder.
They'll be the ones who redesign the model 🧠

Services.
Follow-up.
Continuity.
Care that can actually fund itself ⚙️

The future belongs to the ones who adapt.
