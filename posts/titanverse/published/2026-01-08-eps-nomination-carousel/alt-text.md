### Slide 1 — Alt Text
A Titanverse slide with a dark purple background. The NHS logo appears at the top-left. Large bold text states: "Auto-renomination isn't a technical glitch — it's a consent and system design issue in EPS." At the bottom, an illustration shows two floating platforms: one representing a pharmacy/health system, the other a digital form and chat bubble, connected by a curved digital bridge.

### Slide 2 — Alt Text
A slide with a dark background and an illustration of a patient icon surrounded by tick marks, location pins, and floating clipboard documents. The headline reads: "EPS nomination underpins patient choice and continuity." Below it are bullet points listing what patients expect: choosing their pharmacy, understanding when their choice changes, and explicit consent. A final line explains that stable nomination keeps care predictable and trusted.

### Slide 3 — Alt Text
A minimal Titanverse slide with bold text: "Bulk auto-renomination bypasses informed consent." Supporting text explains how EPS nomination can be changed at scale, automatically, and without fresh patient consent. Additional text clarifies that this isn't about opposing EPS but about closing a design gap that weakens consent.

### Slide 4 — Alt Text
A call-to-action slide urging viewers to support a petition. The headline reads: "Support the petition to stop bulk auto-renominations (link in caption)." Below is a screenshot of the official UK Government petition titled: "Ban technology that enables pharmacies to auto renominate EPS patients in bulk" with a green "Sign this petition" button. Titanverse branding appears at the bottom.
