Effective clinical systems put patient information first, enabling and supporting assessment and clinical decisions. Dispensing and billing information is secondary and often tertiary in importance.
Without effective clinical systems, pharmacist workflow, thought processes and patient care are impeded.

Absolutely Greg. Patient safety has to come first. That is why we are training our AI around pharmacy workflows, not generic models. It starts with the patient and ends with safer decisions. 🙌

Every pharmacy offering NHS and private clinical services needs a clinical management system to support clinical governance and patient experience

Well said Michael. Pharmacy services cannot run on outdated systems or paper and memory. The system has to take the heavy lifting so pharmacists can focus on clinical care. 🙌
