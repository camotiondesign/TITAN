Looping explainer video showing how prescribing is built directly into the consultation. The animation starts with the headline "Prescribing built into the consultation" on a dark, space-style background. Three connected icons appear in sequence: Consultation (audio waveform icon), e-Prescribing (pen icon), and TITAN PMR (TITAN logo). A glowing purple plus symbol animates above the icons as the flow connects from consultation to prescribing to dispensing. The sequence loops smoothly to reinforce that prescribing happens inside the consultation, not as a separate step.
