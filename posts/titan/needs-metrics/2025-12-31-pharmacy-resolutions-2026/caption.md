2026, let's go! 🚀

We're feeling refreshed, motivated, and ready to help UK pharmacies transform like never before.

2025 was just the start. Together, we saw incredible transformations. Pharmacies scaling safely. Pharmacists stepping off the bench. Near misses dropping by 97%. Teams finding their flow.

Now, it's time to aim higher.

Here are the resolutions that will define 2026:

**Scale safely.** More items shouldn't mean more chaos. Build workflows that handle growth without breaking. The goal? Scale without stress.

**Free pharmacist time.** Get off the bench. Get into the consultation room. AI handles routine checks. You handle patient care. The goal? 80% of your time on services, not checking.

**Expand services.** Pharmacy First. Weight loss. Travel clinics. Ear care. The money is in services, not just dispensing. The goal? Services revenue that matches dispensing.

**Reduce near misses.** Safety isn't negotiable. Barcode scanning. AI checks. Real-time tracking. The goal? Near misses drop by 90%+.

**Go paperless.** No more printing. No more tokens. No more waste. Fully digital workflows from start to finish. The goal? 100% paperless by end of 2026.

We've seen pharmacies achieve all of these in 2025. Sagar at Brighton Hill scaled to 17,000 items and spends 80% of his time on services. Asif at Safy's cut near misses by 97% and freed 85% of his time. Teams across the UK went fully paperless.

It's not about working harder. It's about building smarter.
