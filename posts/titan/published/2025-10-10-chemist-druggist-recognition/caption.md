🧠 Chemist+Druggist explored how barcode accuracy is shaping patient safety.

They credited Titan PMR as the pioneer of scan-to-label dispensing,

now used across modern pharmacy.

That single 'beep' is more than tech.

It's confirmation.

✅ It's accuracy.

🛡️ It's safety.

An honourable mention, if we do say so ourselves.

Proud to see Titan recognised for setting the standard in safer dispensing.
