What a weekend. ❤️

The Pharmacy Show is always special, but this year was something else.

So many incredible conversations, stories, and smiles from people who care deeply about the future of pharmacy.

The stand was buzzing, our team was everywhere, and the energy around TITAN PMR and TITANVERSE was unreal.

We loved catching up with old friends, meeting new faces, and hearing how you're transforming pharmacy across the UK.

A big thank you to PharmAppy, DemDx, IPCN - Independent Pharmacy Contractors Network, and Beoncore for being part of it all.

And of course, a huge thank you to our amazing team.

Andy Jessep, Ashley Matthews, Atique, Dan Pinteala, Hooman Ghalamkari Safaei, Jeff Shelley, Jon Flitcroft, Maj Khaliq, Nas Khaliq, Nour Karkach, Rafal Kazynski, Roxanne Heath, Saad Idreas, Sajid Ramzan, Shannon Chappell, Tariq Muhammad, Tony Donnelly, Vicky Carling, Wahid Muhammad, and Zad Bhatti.

Until next year 👋
