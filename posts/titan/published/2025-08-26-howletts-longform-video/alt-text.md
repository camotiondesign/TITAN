**Speaker 1:**  
Meet Pritee — Superintendent and pharmacy owner of Howlett's Pharmacy in Ruislip. She's what we call a strong, independent pharmacist.

**Speaker 2 (Pritee Panchmatia):**  
My name is Pritee and I'm Superintendent at Howlett's Pharmacy. Been here just over 10 years. We dispense around 6,000–6,500 items per month.

Before Titan, the bench was purely baskets waiting to be checked — as fast as we checked, more kept arriving.

Now the environment is less stressful. We get all the jobs done — plus more — because the team is free to assist with services like earwax removal, BP checks and ABPMs, while I monitor results.

Before Titan we struggled — now we hit 60–65 NMS per month and 60–70 BP checks monthly.

The two functions I love most are scanning for accuracy checks and AI. Titan AI checks 50–60 percent of prescriptions, sometimes more. It keeps the dispensary flowing while I handle clinical work for hours without stress.

I save roughly 10 hours per week on checking — possibly more. We've gone from one private consultation a month to two or three a day.

Knowing it is safe is key — removing the human-error element. In three years, only one error has reached a patient.

I've saved money on needing a second pharmacist and more dispensing help.

Technology doesn't replace people — it frees people up. It supplements processes and makes the business more efficient.

If anyone asked whether they should get Titan — I'd say 100% you've got to do it.
