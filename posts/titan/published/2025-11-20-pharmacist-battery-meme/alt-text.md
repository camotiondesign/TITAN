A humorous Titan graphic showing four cartoon characters side by side labelled "Young", "Adult", "Old", and "Pharmacist." Below each character are three battery icons representing Time, Energy, and Money: Young has full time, full energy, empty money; Adult has medium time, low energy, medium money; Old has low time, medium energy, full money; Pharmacist has empty time, empty energy, empty money. The final character — the pharmacist — stands stiffly holding a clipboard, glasses on, exhausted and depleted. TITAN logo at the bottom. The visual joke: Every life stage has at least one battery full… except the pharmacist.
