**Alt Text:**  
A humorous Titan graphic showing four cartoon characters side by side labelled "Young", "Adult", "Old", and "Pharmacist."  
Below each character are three battery icons representing **Time**, **Energy**, and **Money**:

- **Young:** Full time, full energy, empty money.  
- **Adult:** Medium time, low energy, medium money.  
- **Old:** Low time, medium energy, full money.  
- **Pharmacist:** Empty time, empty energy, empty money.  

The final character — the pharmacist — stands stiffly holding a clipboard, glasses on, exhausted and depleted. TITAN logo at the bottom.

The visual joke:  
*Every life stage has at least one battery full… except the pharmacist.*
