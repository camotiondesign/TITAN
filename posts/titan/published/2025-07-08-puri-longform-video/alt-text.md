Meet Rahul. You might recognize him from TikTok with videos such as, "What does your mucus say about you?" He's a superintendent pharmacist at Puri Pharmacy with branches in Southall and Hillingdon, part of a new generation blending frontline care and digital first leadership.

My name is Rahul Puri, and I'm the superintendent pharmacist at Puri Pharmacy in Southall and Hillingdon. We're doing approximately 18,000 items across both branches.

Two years ago, we were frantically using paper, diaries, post-it notes, prescriptions everywhere, scribbling everywhere. Now everything is clearly visible on each screen, whether it be from the inbox when you receive a prescription, all the way to the end for the handout. Everyone can see where the prescription is. No one is frantically looking for paper. We've become a paper free pharmacy.

Titan Core, Repeat Flow and Titan AI have been revolutionary in our pharmacy. We serve a wide population of patients who are on MDS, so dosette boxes, and also patients which we routinely order for. In the older, archaic systems we had to manually do this, but now with Titan Repeat Flow, we press one button and it does it for us.

Titan's SMS feature has allowed us to text patients seamlessly. When the bag is ready for a patient, it simply goes onto a shelf or a tote and a message is sent directly to the patient. Not only has this freed up so much time for our staff, they can now focus on other tasks rather than needlessly sending SMSs to patients.

Since implementing Titan in January 2025 it's freed up at least 20 hours a week for a pharmacist in the pharmacy. Now we can offer double the amount of appointments such as Pharmacy First, which lead to better patient and health outcomes and better revenue for an independent business owner.

Now, people will come to us for things outside the conventional pharmacy realm, such as ear wax removal, medical cannabis, travel vaccines, and now people are commenting, "I didn't realise a pharmacy could do this." So we're now changing our business model from being just a dispensary in a conventional pharmacy to a community health hub.

Titan has given me the freedom to lead from the front, clinically, commercially and creatively.
