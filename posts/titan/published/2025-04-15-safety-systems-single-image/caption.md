❗Mistakes are part of human nature.

So, how do we reduce the risk? 🤔

We train our teams to double-check.
Triple-check.
Stay alert at every step.

But constant vigilance isn't sustainable — it leads to exhaustion, not excellence.

We often say:
"Be careful."
"Double-check everything."
"Don't miss a thing."

But here's the real question:
Why are we still designing systems that assume people won't make mistakes?

The safest workflows don't rely on perfect memory or superhuman focus.
They're built to catch errors automatically.

🧾 Every label
💊 Every item
📄 Every prescription

500 near misses prevented every single day
Not by luck — by design.

Because true safety doesn't come from trying harder.
It comes from building better systems.
