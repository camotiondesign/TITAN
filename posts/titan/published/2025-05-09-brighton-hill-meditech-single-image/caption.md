Pharmacy workflows are under pressure.

Manual tasks. Disconnected systems. Time lost.

That's why we've been working with Meditech UK & I — to connect robot automation with digital PMR workflows.

This week, our teams met at Brighton Hill Pharmacy, where Sagar Lungiwala hosted us for a live look at the integration in action 👀

The result?
➖ Less friction
⚡ More speed
✅ Safer, smarter dispensing

Every second saved means more time for patients.
And that's what this collaboration is all about.

Want to see what efficiency at scale really looks like?
