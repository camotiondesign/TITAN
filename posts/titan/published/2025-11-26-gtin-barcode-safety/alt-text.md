Two medicine boxes are shown side by side against a soft blue gradient background. Above them: "Spot the difference. The GTIN doesn't." Left box: labelled Amoxicillin 500mg. Right box: labelled Cetirizine 10mg. Both boxes display identical barcodes, each highlighted by a faint circular outline. The point: two completely different medicines sharing the same GTIN barcode, creating a clear patient-safety risk. TITAN logo bottom-left. Hashtag #EveryPackCounts bottom-right.
