Other PMRs trying to copy TITAN, mark an item as being clinically checked and then no need to be checked again for 6-12 months. What happens if a new medication is prescribed for the patient in month 2 and it interacts with the medication that has been marked as clinically checked? Surely the whole medication therapy needs to be considered and assessed. That is why Titan carries out its checks on every prescription every time, ensuring no assumptions are made and highlighting risk factors for pharmacists to consider in carrying out their clinical checks.

Ruth Hulton I agree its complicated especially for Superintendent Pharmacists who are ultimately responsible. There are two important concepts that Titan AI tries to address as part of its design: Trust and Control.

Trust - That high risk meds are always reviewed by pharmacists every time. You can even set the meds, scenarios (eg new patients) and groups of patients (eg MDS) that you don't want AI to be applied to.

Titan AI is based on learning from pharmacists interventions on prescriptions. Anyone who wants to use Titan AI is encouraged to understand how it works, learns and applies its learning.
You can also run Titan AI in partial mode, where the AI makes changes but a pharmacist has to approve the changes.

Control - pharmacists are in control of how long the TITAN AI is applied for, typically 2-4 hours.
After each period pharmacists have to do a statistically significant sample audit before they can run the AI again. 

Measures like the above show the sophistication that Titan AI has and this is why hundreds of Titan customers are using it and achieving efficiencies without compromising patient safety.

Its always the same with these "copy and paste" pmr providers. Except they can't even copy and paste properly. Hiding their inability to innovate behind a thin veneer of "efficiency" without realising that they are fundamentally impacting the safety element, and increasing the risk profile of the pharmacy. We don't want to sacrifice safety at the altar of efficency. We need efficency within a robust, clinically safe envelope. If they can't do that, it's better they stick to traditional dispensing processes, rather than drive risk into the sector. Real time clinical checks , utilising tech appropriately, every time please!

Titan gets it! Patients aren't static, so checks shouldn't be either.🫡

Bang on, Mandeep. Static checks miss dynamic risks. Smarter systems need to move with the patient. 🙌
