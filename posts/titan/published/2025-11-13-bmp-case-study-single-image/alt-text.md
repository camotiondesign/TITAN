My name is Yusuf. I'm the head of pharmacy for BNP healthcare. We have around 150 staff across all of our branches. And items wise, we are doing about 170,000 a month.

We first started with the branch we're in today, back in 2017. Now we have a nice group of 12 currently. Pharmacy, at the time, worked differently. Everyone was chasing items, but at the end of it, ultimately, the pharmacist has still got to stand there checking those prescriptions in any of our branches.

Now with Titan, they're a pharmacist who isn't working with any ATT your checking is down to between 20 and 30%. You'll find that the pharmacist is planted inside their consultation room, and that's where they should be.

I mean, services in some of our branches were basically non existent before Titan. Our services have increased in some branches by 500%. Barcode scanning is massive. If you were to walk into our pharmacy at a busy hour, you'd probably feel like you walked into the checkout at Tescos, because all you hearing is beeping, nonstop, scanning, scan, scan. And that's what I want to hear.

It's auditable. You're able to see the time, the batch number, the expiry date, individually scanned it. And that's all because it's a strict process. And because of that, there is no more guesswork when a patient comes through the door, and by simply typing in your name, you know at what stage they're at instantly.

With our previous PMR, unless it was ready completed and in a drawer, you almost had to do a bit of guesswork to figure out where that would be. And if people hadn't stuck to the process, it could have been a number of places.

Batch flow has double the speed of normal dispensing. You scan it, it tells you what basket to put it in. You affix the label, and you put it in. By making it as simple as that, it's probably made it infinitely more safer.

There is no other PMR company out there listening to everyone's suggestions and things like that. It doesn't happen. There's not one software provider that will do that in the pharmacy industry, other than Titan.

Change is always difficult for a lot of people, especially when you've been using a PMR for so long. Titan empowers the staff to be able to take control of the dispensary. They actually feel like they have more responsibility and more control over it.

We haven't reduced our staffing levels. We're actually looking to improve the capabilities of our staff.

We're not chasing items anymore. We're about service. That's what pharmacies should be. Titan allows you to do that, and I can't say the same for a lot of other PMRs.
