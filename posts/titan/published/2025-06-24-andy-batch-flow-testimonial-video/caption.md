Most pharmacies lose time ⏱️

Andy's lost 50 staff hours a week

"We're doing a 10,000-item pharmacy and didn't hit a road bump. It literally went as smooth as it ever has done." ✅

The difference?

🛠️ "The introduction of Batch Flow has made a huge difference."

👤 "You can dispense a couple of hundred items with one member of staff in a morning."

🛒 "Learning to use Titan is like learning to use a Sainsbury's self-checkout."
