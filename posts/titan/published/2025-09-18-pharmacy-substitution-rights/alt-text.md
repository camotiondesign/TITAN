## Slide Alt Text Descriptions

**Slide 1 — "3 Weeks No Meds"**  
Illustration of a desk calendar made of blue felt, with nine dates marked with large red Xs and a pointing hand emoji highlighting the delay. Large bold headline reads "3 WEEKS NO MEDS," with a subheading: "Patients wait because pharmacists cannot substitute." Titan logo bottom-left.

**Slide 2 — "Blocked at the Bench"**  
A red octagonal stop sign labelled "BLOCKED." Headline reads "BLOCKED AT THE BENCH." Subtext explains pharmacists know safe swaps and patients need them fast, but regulation requires sending them back to the GP.

**Slide 3 — "Everyone Loses"**  
A diverse group of illustrated characters push a gigantic blue medical capsule across the frame. Headline reads "EVERYONE LOSES." Bullet points list: Patients left untreated; Surgeries flooded with calls; Pharmacies blamed for the rules.

**Slide 4 — "Time for Change"**  
A blue-and-white megaphone hangs by strings with sound lines radiating. Headline reads "TIME FOR CHANGE." Text states the CCA and others call for wider substitution powers, deprescribing roles, more frontline flexibility. Titan logo at bottom.

**Slide 5 — "Care Without Delay"**  
A stylised winding road with medicine packs, clouds and signs alongside. Headline: "CARE WITHOUT DELAY." Bullet points explain pharmacists could adjust in store during shortages, cut weeks of waiting and keep care moving safely.

**Slide 6 — "Teslas Can Drive Themselves"**  
Minimal white background with bold text: "TESLAS CAN DRIVE THEMSELVES. BUT PHARMACISTS CAN'T SWAP A PILL..." A speech bubble beneath says "…Nice one 👍." Titan logo at bottom.
