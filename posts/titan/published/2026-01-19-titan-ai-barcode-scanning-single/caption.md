Don't rely on manual checking.

Use TITAN AI + Barcode scanning.

Manual checking collapses as volume rises. Fatigue builds. Risk goes up. One interruption is enough for the wrong item to be picked.

Pharmacies switching to Titan see the same pattern:

• Manual checking drops to 20–30%
• Near misses fall to a couple a year
• Workflows scale from 4k to 17k items without chaos
• AI clears most routine checks up-front
• Barcode scanning locks in the item-to-patient match

This is enforced safety.
Not memory. Not vigilance.

A system that removes the bottleneck and keeps the line moving.
