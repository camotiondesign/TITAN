THE SERIAL CHECKER

### Alt description

A cinematic, thriller-style image inspired by American Psycho. A sharply dressed, intense-looking pharmacist stands in a dimly lit dispensary with medication shelves blurred behind him. He stares directly into the camera while holding out a prescription label as if it is a dramatic reveal. The composition mimics a movie poster, parodying psychological thriller tropes.

### Context

This visual uses pop culture satire to critique outdated "serial checking" culture in pharmacy. Designed to highlight inefficiency, burnout, and reliance on manual checking rather than intelligent systems.
