Bulk nomination is undermining patient choice.

And it has created a completely unfair playing field.

Some PMR systems allow pharmacies to switch patients back in bulk, without consent and without a conversation. Patients have no idea their nomination has changed behind their backs.

Pharmacies who refuse to do this lose business.
Pharmacies who do it gain business.
That isn't fair competition. It's a broken system.

Bulk switching goes directly against patient choice.
And it punishes the pharmacies who try to do the right thing.

There are only two legitimate scenarios for a bulk nomination change:
• When a pharmacy is sold
• When two pharmacies merge
And even then, the NHS manages the change — not the PMR system.

Everywhere else, nomination should stay where it belongs:
with the patient.

If you agree this needs to stop, take a stand with us.
