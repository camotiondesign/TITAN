Slide 1 — Cartoon pharmacist surrounded by mountains of blue baskets, looking overwhelmed. Text: "TITAN — Too Many Baskets Again" with pointing emoji.

Slide 2 — White minimalist slide. Large text: "More baskets means more staff." Subtext lists volume rising, people stretched, and "hire more." Small paragraph challenges whether the problem is headcount or the system.

Slide 3 — Blue gradient slide. Large text: "Hiring isn't scaling." Bullet points: out of space, out of budget, still checking. Subtext: every new hire becomes just another pair of hands for a broken system.

Slide 4 — White slide. Large text: "The real issue is flow." Lists manual checking, zero prioritisation, paper everywhere. Subtext: no wonder the baskets keep coming.

Slide 5 — Blue slide. Large text: "TITAN fixes the bottlenecks." Bullet checklist: barcode scanning, AI checks, remote screening, batch-led dispensing. Subtext: team stays focused; baskets stop piling up.

Slide 6 — White slide. Large text: "Same team less stress." Subtext: no extra hires, no fire-fighting, no need to check every script. Summary: smarter system carries the load.

Slide 7 — Blue slide. Large text: "It's time to breathe." Subtext: not doing more — doing it better. Notes team deserves backup, not burnout.

Slide 8 — White slide with thumbnails of Titan case studies. Large text: "See how others scaled smarter" with URL titanpmr.com/case-studies.
