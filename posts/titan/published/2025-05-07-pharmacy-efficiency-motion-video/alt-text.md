Motion-graphics video promoting pharmacy workflow improvements using Titan. A loading bar animates along the bottom with text reading "Boost your pharmacy's efficiency." A digital Kanban-style prescription board appears with tasks moving across stages to illustrate streamlined workflow. A hub-and-spoke graphic then animates to show workloads being shared efficiently across pharmacy locations. A floating QR code appears next, demonstrating one-scan management for improved dispensing accuracy. The video closes with Titan branding as all elements animate smoothly throughout.
