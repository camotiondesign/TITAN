A black handheld barcode scanner with blue accents is shown in the centre of a comic-book style poster. The background is bright blue with illustrated medicine boxes, barcode labels and dynamic comic bursts. The word "BEEP" appears in large block letters at the top, with more comic text effects and action lines radiating outward, giving the impression of motion and scanning power.
