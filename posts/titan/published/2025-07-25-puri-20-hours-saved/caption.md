From checking mountains of baskets

To 20+ hours saved per pharmacist.

Before Titan, Rahul was stuck at the bench.

⚠️ Every day started the same:
A mountain of scripts.
No backup.
No headspace.
Just constant checking.

"There was no headspace. I'd always be firefighting."

And that was with two busy branches,
18,000 items a month,
and services on the rise.

So what changed?

👉 Titan PMR did the one thing no other PMR could:
It gave pharmacists their time back.

✅ AI clears most scripts automatically
✅ Clinical checks and dosage errors flagged in seconds
✅ The dispensary flows — without pharmacist bottlenecks

Now Rahul leads from the front.
Delivers more services.
And has built a calm, clinically focused pharmacy.
