Outdated pharmacy workflows are slowing everything down, and your PMR isn't helping. Some even have an automatic print feature which turns your prescriptions into a growing pile of paper, and they call it automation.  

The reality is slow, messy, and it doesn't work.  

So we built something better, no paper, no voxel necks, no wasted time.  

This is the Titan way, a seamless digital first workflow designed for the modern pharmacy, and here's how it works.  

Prescriptions arrive digitally and stay digital, no printing and no paperwork.  

Using Titan AI, prescriptions go through a 40 point clinical check. Dosages are automatically corrected, and only high risk items are flags to the pharmacist.  

A smart prescription board prioritizes prescriptions so the right ones are processed first.  

Dispensers pick and scan stock, no searching and no second guessing. Barcode validation ensures accuracy for correct patient, correct drug and correct strength, along with an expiry check before any label prints.  

Bagging and shelving are fully tracked. Patients get an SMS with a collection code so staff never waste time searching.  

Collection is instant, because prescriptions are found by code on shelves, in the fridge, in the CD, cupboard, no delays, no missing items.  

Pharmacists focus on care. Dispensers work efficiently, and the patient gets what they need without the weight.  

And this is just pharmacy the way it should be.  

This is the Titan way.
