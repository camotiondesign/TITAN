💥 Mounjaro prices are up 170% and pharmacies are feeling it!

Here's what really changed 👇

From 1 September, Mounjaro's list price jumps by up to 170%.

But the real shock isn't just the cost. Pharmacies must now:

1️⃣ Pay the higher price upfront

2️⃣ File monthly rebate reports (splitting NHS vs private)

3️⃣ Wait for retrospective rebates — still unclear in detail

For independents running on tight margins, that's a cashflow crisis.

For patients, it risks confusion, delays, and unsafe online alternatives.

That's why within days, Titan PMR launched a custom reporting suite — now used by 1,000+ pharmacies to:

✔ Generate rebate data in minutes

✔ Stay compliant without drowning in admin

✔ Keep the focus on patients, not paperwork

When global shocks land in local pharmacy…

👉 Titan moves fast.
