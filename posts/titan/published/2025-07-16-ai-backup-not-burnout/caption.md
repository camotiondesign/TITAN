Pharmacy is broken.

But it's not pharmacists that need fixing.

It's the systems around them.

Outdated tools. Manual errors. No backup.

Titan AI clears up to 90% of scripts.
Safely. Precisely. Reliably.

That means:
• Pharmacists are freed up
• Dispensers are empowered
• Manual errors disappear
• Item volumes rise
• Stress levels fall

This is pharmacy with backup.
Not burnout.
