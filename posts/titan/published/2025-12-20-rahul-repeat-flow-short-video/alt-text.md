Titan core repeat flow and Titan aI have been revolutionary in our pharmacy. We serve a wide population of patients who are on MDS so Dossett boxes, and also patients which we routinely order for in the older archaic systems, we had to manually do this, but now with Titan repeat flow, we press one button and it does it for us. Titan's SMS feature has allowed us detects patients seamlessly. When the bag is ready for a patient, it simply goes on to a shelf or a tote and a message is sent directly to the patient. Not only has this freed up so much time for our staff, they can now focus on other tasks rather than needlessly sending us a message to patients. Since implementing Titan in January 2025 it's freed up at least 20 hours a week for a pharmacist in the pharmacy now, we can offer double the amount of appointments such as pharmacy first, which lead to better patient and health outcomes and better revenue for an independent business owner.
