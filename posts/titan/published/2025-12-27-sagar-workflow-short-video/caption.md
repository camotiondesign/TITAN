In the busiest hours of pharmacy, chaos is not inevitable.

It's a design problem.

When workflow is clear, pressure doesn't escalate.
Teams know where prescriptions are, what stage they're at, and what's ready next.

Clear tracking from receipt to collection.
Fewer interruptions.
Most prescriptions ready the same day.

Volume went up.
Stress didn't.
