## Video Description

A short video featuring an existing Titan user at their newly adopted pharmacy. The video opens with members of the pharmacy team standing just outside the entrance, positioned next to a window sticker reading "Powered by TITAN." They are wearing black TITAN-branded hoodies, clearly visible in the frame. The scene then cuts to a brief talking segment inside the pharmacy, where a team member speaks directly to camera about using Titan and why they value the system in their new pharmacy. The overall tone is warm and authentic, combining real-world adoption of Titan with the launch of the TITAN merchandise and its charitable purpose.
