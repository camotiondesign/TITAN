Two-panel comic-style meme showing a cartoon dog calmly sitting in a room that is on fire, representing a pharmacy under pressure. Text at the top reads, "When more items come in and your PMR just… sits there doing nothing." In the panels, baskets labelled with pharmacy tasks such as owing scripts, chasing GPs, and service consults sit around the dog while flames surround the room, and the dog says, "This is fine," highlighting frustration when pharmacy systems fail to keep up with workload.
