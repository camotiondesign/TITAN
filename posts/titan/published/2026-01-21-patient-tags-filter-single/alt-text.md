Blue gradient background with large text reading "Filter out the noise". In the foreground, a UI-style card labelled "Patient Tags" shows toggle switches for Care home, MDS (switched on), and Delivery. Behind it is a blurred view of the Titan Prescription Board displaying patient names, statuses and workflow stages. A small blue label reading "Dispenser" points to the active MDS tag. Titan logo appears at the bottom.
