That's how long Lauren and the team had been doing things the same way.

So switching to a new PMR system?
Big deal. Especially in the busiest site yet — 25,000+ items a month.

So what happened?
The team didn't ease in. They got straight on with it. Full hands-on use of Titan from day one.

And that turned out to be a good thing.

"It actually made them more confident." — Yusuf Abdulali Head of Pharmacy, BMP Healthcare Group

So what's changed?

"I'm seeing less work coming my way — and more time for services." — Anoop, pharmacist and multi-site operator

"It frees up a lot of time. And the accuracy is there too." — Lauren

Would they recommend it?
Already are. And eight sites in, they've still got three to go.
