Pharmacy has changed. So have the demands.

Paper is slow. Switching between systems wastes time. Printing clogs the workflow.
These aren't small inconveniences. They're structural problems.

With real-time visibility. With Kanban-style clarity. With space to think.

If your PMR can't support that,
it's no longer fit for purpose.
