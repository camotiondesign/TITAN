The patient comes first. 

Stop nomination ping-pong.

The NHS Electronic Prescription Service is one of the most advanced prescribing systems in the world. It works because patient nomination is meant to be clear, deliberate, and respected.

But there is a flaw. Some systems can automatically reverse a patient's pharmacy nomination, without the patient knowing.

When that happens, prescriptions can bounce between pharmacies. Patients lose clarity about where their medicines are. Trust takes the hit first. And pharmacies playing fair are put at a disadvantage.

At scale, this creates risk for EPS itself. It was not designed for businesses to fight over nominations through automation.

We were asked to build this functionality. We refused. Not because we couldn't, but because it breaches our values around patient safety, professional standards, and fair competition.

Patient choice must mean something.
