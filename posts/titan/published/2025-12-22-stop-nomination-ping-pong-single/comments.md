The only case for Bulk Nomination Change is when there is a sale or consolidation of pharmacies which triggers a change of ODS. Even in these scenarios only the NHS teams should be able to do this, not PMR providers.

I have signed. We have list of patients whoes nomination gets switched every months and they are not aware about this. This happens to those who joined recently from other pharmacy.
