**Image:** 2025-10-29-peer-to-peer-hub-spoke-meme.png

**Alt Text:**  
A meme using the "distracted boyfriend" template. The labelled "Pharmacy Owner" character looks back temptingly at an image showing a Hub and Spoke diagram, while walking alongside another diagram representing Peer-to-Peer networking. Text overlays compare "Peer to Peer" and "Hub & Spoke" as two models of prescription workflow across multiple branches. The caption at the bottom reads: "WHEN YOUR PMR DOESN'T OFFER BOTH." Visual message: a PMR that only supports one model limits flexibility — modern pharmacy requires both.

**Pop Culture Reference:**  
Distracted Boyfriend meme format (also known as "Distracted Boyfriend" or "Woman Yelling at a Cat" style meme template)
