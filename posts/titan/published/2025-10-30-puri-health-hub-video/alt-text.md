Our people will come to us for things outside the conventional pharmacy realm, such as they'll come to us for ear wax removal, for medical cannabis, travel, vaccines. And now people are commenting, *"I didn't realize a pharmacy could do this."* So we're now changing our business model from being just a dispensary in a conventional pharmacy to a **community health home**.
