Pharmacies are losing up to 3 hours a day ⏱️

And it's not because of the team.

We've spoken to pharmacists and dispensers in 2,000-item independents and 15,000+ item sites.

The same patterns keep showing up:
🔁 Chasing
🔍 Rechecking
🗣️ Handover confusion

Every day ends the same way:
"Where did the time go?"

This isn't about working harder.

It's about what your system is doing quietly in the background — or what it's not.

If your PMR isn't saving you time…
…it might be the one stealing it.
