A Proud Moment for Titan PMR – EPS is Now Fully Rolled Out Across Wales

On 17th November 2023, Titan PMR made history.

We became the first PMR to deploy EPS in Wales, with Wellington Road Pharmacy in Rhyl leading the way.

Patients there were the first in Wales to experience a fully digital prescription process.

Now, EPS is fully rolled out across all Titan pharmacies in Wales, marking a major milestone in our mission to transform pharmacy care.

What does this mean for pharmacies?

✅ No more paper prescriptions → Fully digital workflow  

✅ Faster, safer dispensing → Fewer errors, better stock control  

✅ Less admin, more efficiency → Simplified reimbursements and operations  

💬 "Visiting Wellington Road Pharmacy, I witnessed firsthand the benefits of the Electronic Prescription Service, which allows GPs to send prescriptions securely online to the patient's choice of community pharmacy, eliminating the need for paper forms." — Eluned Morgan MS

💡 This is just the beginning. At Titan PMR, we're committed to driving the future of pharmacy innovation.
