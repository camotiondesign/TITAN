💥 What if dispensing didn't eat up every hour of the day?

This is Faz, dispenser at Howletts Pharmacy in Ruislip.

And in this brilliant tutorial, she shows exactly how Titan Batch Flow works in practice:

✔ QR-coded baskets

✔ Every item scanned, every time

✔ Split packs flagged automatically

✔ Dispensing up to 15 baskets at once

The result?

Less back-and-forth.

Less stress on the pharmacist.

More time in the diary for services and patients.

Thank you Faz for walking us through it 🙌 And thank you Pritee Panchmatia, for building a pharmacy culture where digital tools free your team to shine.
