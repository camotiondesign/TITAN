An illustrated, stylised diagram showing a chaotic digital prescription workflow. The background resembles a tablet or screen filled with tangled pathways, pop-up messages, and warning labels. Multiple alert boxes appear across the image reading phrases such as "Manual check required," "Patient waiting…," "Clinical check needed," "Error: missing information," "Prescription workflow blocked," and "Print all prescriptions." Lines snake between these boxes in a confusing, maze-like layout, suggesting repeated interruptions and bottlenecks. Red medical kits with white crosses and scattered paper documents float around the screen, reinforcing a sense of overload and risk. In the foreground, a large hand is shown tapping a highlighted alert, implying constant manual intervention. The overall tone conveys operational complexity, inefficiency, and cognitive strain within a pharmacy dispensing workflow.
