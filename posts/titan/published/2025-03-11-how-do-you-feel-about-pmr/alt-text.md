A bold promotional graphic with the headline "How do you really feel about your PMR?" in large black and blue text at the top. Below, a stylised illustration shows a stressed man in a suit standing in the middle of a pharmacy dispensary, arms raised as papers fly around him chaotically. Shelves of medicine boxes line the background, and open drawers spill documents, creating a sense of overload and loss of control. The colour palette is teal, orange, and cream, with dynamic motion suggesting chaos and pressure. The TITAN logo appears at the bottom left, reinforcing the branding.
