Safy's Chemist was losing time every single day 👀

Dispensing 14,500 to 15,000 items a month, and they felt the pace.

Baskets piling up.
Running between rooms.
Checking, bagging and shelving in between appointments.
Back and forth all day.

For Asif, that rhythm felt normal for a busy pharmacy.

Titan changed that completely.

He now spends about an hour in the dispensary across a full day.
Around 85 percent of his time is spent outside it.
The team runs the process.
He can sit with patients.
People mention it in their reviews ⭐

Safety changed as well.
On ProScript, they had five or six near misses a month.
Since moving to Titan, they have had two in an entire year.
Both were human errors, not system issues.

As Asif puts it:
"Now I have zero worries. Honestly, it's the best thing that's happened."

His story shows something many pharmacies overlook.
You are losing more time than you think.
Once that changes, everything else follows.
