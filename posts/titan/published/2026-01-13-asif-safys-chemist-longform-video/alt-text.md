**Asif:**  
I'm Asif, and this is Safy's Chemist. I'm a pharmacist here. Safy himself has been serving the community in this area for about 45 years.  

We currently hit between fourteen and a half to fifteen thousand items a month. It's a busy pharmacy. It's a very busy pharmacy, although it doesn't seem it.

It's been a night and day difference between ProScript and now having Titan. Before, it was non stop. Baskets piling up. I'd perhaps do a travel job in here, then I'd run to the back in between my jobs, start checking, bagging, getting them on the shelf, and then running back in here for my next appointment. Back and forth constantly.

I have the peace of mind now to know that my staff can handle the dispensary. In fact, I rarely go in the dispensary anymore, just for a coffee every now and then. But that's it.

The staff are well trained. They know what they're doing with Titan. And it's not rocket science.

So I'm here from nine to six thirty. From a full day, which is a nine hour day, all the way down to maybe an hour and a bit at most. Eighty five percent of my time, pretty much, I can sit here, do my jobs, spend time with my patients.

A lot of our reviews will show that on Google as well. A lot of people appreciate that I'm spending time with them.

We would have between five to six near misses a month easily on ProScript. I've had two since we've had Titan, and that's in a year. And they have been human errors again.

Now I have zero worries. Honestly, it's the best thing that's happened.

I've recommended Titan to enough people for it to be genuine enough for me to say that, look, this is making a difference. It's changed our pharmacy.

One of my friends in Nottingham has just taken it on. He's delighted with it. A couple of firms on the road have taken it on since we had it. From the feedback I gather, everyone is over the moon with the fact that they can now focus on what's actually bringing in money, which is the services.

Well, if you're in this area and you're thinking about getting Titan, don't get it, stick to paper. If you're anywhere else, take the plunge. Honestly, the best thing ever.
