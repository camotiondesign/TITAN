Paula started the day feeling nervous about her training.

She said she was “very” scared to begin with.

As the session went on, things became clearer.
“Really good… loads better… not that complicated… easier than I thought.”

Her checklist was already a quarter done.
Her pace was “very quick”.
And when asked if she was liking it, she said “yes”.

A simple start.
Steady progress.
Training that becomes easier once you begin.
