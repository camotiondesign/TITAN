# Tone and Copy Structures

Store reusable copy frameworks, tone guidelines, and messaging structures here.

Examples:
- `carousel-copy-structure.md`
- `single-image-copy-structure.md`
- `video-script-structure.md`
- `hook-formats.md`
- `tone-reference.md`

Each file should include:
- Proven copy structures from top performers
- Performance context
- When to use each structure
- Tone guidelines by product/campaign type
